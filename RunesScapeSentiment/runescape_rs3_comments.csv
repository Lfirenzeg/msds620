This level of candor in regard to monetization is extremely refreshing to hear from a company.

While I will retain a healthy level of skepticism after so many years of dealing with bad monetization, I’m excited to see how far this goes.

And I know it will never happen, but I’d love if some of the more garish MTX cosmetics were removed from the game. Barring that, just give us the option to hide them client-side so we can still see our own cosmetics while hiding others’.",2025-06-25 15:02:39,184

I'll believe it when I see it.

Point of fact, we've seen statements like this before, full of bold plans and ideas and boilerplate feel-good statements from Jagex's higher-ups. And what's come of it? Nothing. No change for the better - in some cases, it's even gotten worse. You took the feedback about Squeal of Fortune, and created Treasure Hunter - and the situation has only deteriorated as time has gone on. You took the feedback from Yak Track, and tried to make Hero Pass - a much more disgusting iteration of a battle pass mechanic, that tainted the release of Necromancy with its proximity, to the point that it almost felt like you'd timed the release of the two to try and soften the blow of Hero Pass being as awful as it was. You started off with TH offering a 200m cash stack, and even that's been crept upon by the occasional release of promotions that offer as much as a *billion*, not to mention the potential of getting multipliers on coin drops - according to your own metrics, released just a month ago, this has resulted in Treasure Hunter being the sixth largest source of inflation in the entire game.

I say this not to be cruel, or overly negative, but to state plainly - the pattern of behavior Jagex has demonstrated on this front over the past decade has given us little reason to believe you on this topic. You have repeatedly damaged the playerbase's trust in you on this matter, and it will take serious work to repair that damage. I see a few good ideas in this - but that's all they are from where I'm sitting. But at the same time, I've seen good ideas from you on this topic before, and many of them have simply failed to materialize.

Run your experiments. I, for one, will watch, wait, and see. If, as I *hope*, this leads to actual substantial change, I'll be the first to sing your praises from the rooftops for all to hear. But if, as I currently *suspect*, the temporary nature of these experiments makes the changes as ephemeral as your plans in the past... I won't be surprised, but I will be disappointed. Time, I suppose, will tell.",2025-06-25 15:28:12,1374

It's no secret to anyone (both players and also the general public) that Jagex has been in the news and exposed in good, bad and ugly ways based on many years of decisions.

This is a bold and refreshing take. On a surface level, the devs are stating they want to drive this based on data analytics, findings, feedback, which is a positive. How open is Jagex going to be with the numbers? Many use data that becomes available to run their own analytics so will this be corporate statements that have tailored findings, or will you actually be accountable and transparent?

The risk management approach to all of this bodes well for an industry plagued by issues. Some games have cosmetic mounts that cost more than the game itself, while other games require tens of thousands to get the best items in the game. Seeing the company discuss business longevity and player engagement is a major step forward.

Many of us are cautiously optimistic with statements like these. It falls on Jagex to step up and follow through on this or to just let it get washed away by the next news cycles.",2025-06-25 15:09:04,40

After getting burnt for so many years, the community should rightfully be skeptical about these kinds of statements. Optimistic, but skeptical.

Experiments seems like a good approach. We've seen far too many blatant missteps from Jagex over the years that, frankly, could have been avoided entirely by simply asking the community. But hopefully, some time-limited experiments will actually give some useful feedback.

On the note of cosmetics-restricted worlds, I think it'd be a lot more appealing if that was just a toggle each player could choose to enable or disable at will. I presume it is easier from a technical perspective to have worlds that force-disable them, rather than intent a whole new cosmetics toggling system, but I hope the final implementation of such a system wouldn't be world-bound.",2025-06-25 15:08:37,20

It makes me very optimistic for the game's future. But I worry about what kind of information these short experiments will give?


I believe that an announcement of TH being removed forever would bring back a lot of lapsed players. But I can't imagine anyone coming back to the game because of it being removed for one week. My expectation is that the data for briefly removing TH would just show less income with little increase in engagement.


I also worry that putting up a bunch of old cosmetics for a limited time will create a FOMO rush that does not accurately reflect long-term interest. I would hate to see the game run out of money because you put too much stake in people's desire to buy outfits.


The experiment I would like to see is 2-3 months with no TH, with the understanding that if it's going well that TH simply never returns at the end. I bet people would come flooding back if that was announced. But I recognize how unrealistic that is, and it carries a real risk of an EOC-level controversy which might even end the game if the experiment was unsuccessful and TH had to return.


But don't listen to me. I'm one of the weirdos who really liked hero pass after the initial changes so clearly I don't know what the players want. It's a tricky problem. I really respect your willingness to take on this big risk by trying to tackle it. Good luck!",2025-06-25 16:31:43,18

MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,mzq2ul0,ZombieRichardNixonx,"I have played Runescape for over 22 years. I stuck with RS3 well into the EOC and MTX era before switching to OSRS primarily back in 2016. A few years back, I rejoined RS3 on an Ironman, and loved it... for a while.

Given all that, here's what I think.

It's too late. Nobody wants to hear that, but from a position largely on the outside-looking-in, I truly believe that's the case. MTX could be removed in its entirety tomorrow, but the stain of it will always loom over this game like a dark shadow. A corruption of what was, and the destruction of what could be.

And yet, Runescape 3 is a great game; way better than most of the OSRS community and broader MMO community would give it credit for. The PVM is excellent, the quest design is world-class, the new areas are stunning. And yet, the game flounders, seemingly stuck beneath 30k concurrent players indefinitely. So how do we fix that?

Step 1: A real fresh start. Not ""Fresh Start Worlds"", as in the offensive experiment that required a new subscription and gave characters with accelerated progress a shortcut back into the main game. I mean REAL fresh start servers. A total do-over. Create a series of servers that function like OSRS. If you log into them, it's on a new version of your character, period. The old servers won't go anywhere, but these new ones will be forever quarantined from the rot of years of pervasive corruption.

Step 2: Systems and UI rework. It's just too much, on both counts. Secondary systems are bloated to the point of overwhelm, and the UI is complex and confusing. As it stands, the game is entirely unapproachable to new players, including those who are already OSRS players. There's a lot of dead tissue that needs to be pruned from the game, and it would be a lot of work, but I think it would be necessary and ultimately highly fruitful work.

Step 3: Completely rework MTX. No form of progression-based MTX should ever touch these new servers. Cosmetics are a maybe, but a lot of players are put off by them, since wearing your progress is such a quintessentially Runescape thing that no longer applies in RS3. Total elimination may not be viable for monetization, but I think the community at large would be much more okay with cosmetics than any other form of MTX, so long as those cosmetics are thematically cohesive, which they often aren't.

Step 4: Retrofit the map. This one is a tall order, but I think it's necessary. Runescape 3 looks great when it looks great. The problem is, it often doesn't. As it stands, the game is a mishmash of at least 5 different graphic styles spanning 20 years. In some places, it's subtle. In others, it's egregious, and modifying the shading and textures simply won't cut it. This is a world map with stunning peripherals bordering a flat, bland, and cluttered interior, and it just doesn't work. Going from a place like Um, or Anachronia, or Senntisten, to a place like Varrock isn't just inconsistent, it's jarring. It feels like two (or three) different games, and it shouldn't. New content is great, and everybody wants it, but I truly believe that taking a hiatus from active development to achieve graphical parity throughout the entire world map would breathe an insane amount of life into this game.

I know these are lofty ideals, but I truly believe that this is what it would take to bring RS3 back from the brink. This game has been my home for the vast majority of my life. RS3 may no longer be my main base, but I still love it, and I care about it's future, and it's a game that doesn't deserve to be stuck on life support.",2025-06-25 16:36:23,109

What I hope is that they have follow-through. It can be easy to say this and do short Experiments, but actually changing your monetization strategy is no easy feat. I’m fully of the mindset that increasing player satisfaction can lead to long term benefits, but it’s easy to see MTX revenue and want to double down because retention and customer satisfaction unfortunately have no line item and can be hard to defend in a business environment.

But we also need to tone down putting GP into the game. It inflates everything. I have no issue with buying bonds to sell on the GE for GP. In fact selling bonds for GP stopped a lot of the issues of bots and GP sellers after Jagex finally caved and started basically giving players a way to just buy GP.

I’m not against that. But what I am against is just adding more GP to the game where it raises the prices of EVERYTHING to this astronomical point with items that have no business being that damn expensive.

I also would like to see outfits removed from TH and just outright sold. I would like to see a way for skilling outfits to be made or earned. 

I would like to see a way for EXP boosting, because let’s face it, I am a single father, the EXP boosts did help cut down the amount of time I have to spend grinding a skill. 

I wasn’t a fan of skill caps being raised even higher but the fact that you could get stars to quickly get up to 120 then normal made it sting less. And I get not everyone will agree with me. They grind in the game to get their levels, I grind my RL job to help keep get levels. 

I just want to see balance of GP and EXP expectations. You can’t just cut it completely out because people like me have grown used to that. You can’t fully keep it in either because it ruins the fun for others.

As a casual player who works full time, has other commitments but adores playing RS3, I don't often have hours and hours to play the game. TH is far from perfect and really needs a revamp (would not argue with Protean disappearing) but stars/lamps (more so stars) are such a boost to be able to get even a little bonus XP to help maximise on the time I have is brilliant and keeps the game engaging so that I feel I'm achieving something with the little time I have. My concern is taking away ALL of that will give me less incentive to login and grind for the hour or two I might have and feel like it wasn't worth anything.

Bonus XP from TH absolutely should not be the driving force to levelling, but it can be a valuable helping hand to a more casual player with less time, and putting any chance of bonus XP behind a forced pay wall doesn't sound good to me. Hell, even reduce/slightly nerf the given XP.

This may sound like a selfish motivation, but I wanted to add my feedback, and I know a lot of people won't agree, which is perfectly cool but maybe there are others with similar concerns.",2025-06-27 20:01:30,8

***
&nbsp;

###Thank you

Despite all the issues the game and its monetization have, I am very glad to see Jagex are willing and actively taking steps to make improvements. It's also nice to see the community suggested monetization models and concepts suggested in the past finally get a chance to shine.

&nbsp;

###This is the beginning of a LONG TERM Project

Even though Jagex plan on doing these experiments there shouldn't be an expectation the game will improve over night. The game's current monetization model took years to take shape and its current playerbase has formed around its existence. Players have left, xp and gp valuation have changed, and the design structure of content in-relation to that was altered. 

**None of this will change during the duration of the experiments.**

The take-aways of these projects should acknowledge that it could take months before many of the benefits of these alternative designs are seen. In some cases it may expose many of the game's flaws caused by the current monetization model which was previously not as obvious. I do hope Jagex don't dismiss any alternative model simply because it didn't work in a 2 week time-frame. Additionally I hope they communicate what can/can't be measured within the time-frame of the experiement.


&nbsp;


###Why now?

This isn't something I expect an answer to but it's something that has to be asked.

Players have been asking for this for years. We've been wanting alternative models or at the very least trial different things such as ""Cosmetic Free Worlds"". In the past every time we were told, it was too risky, or it wouldn't work. On occasion Jagex would trial something, but it was always alongside existing monetization and the players would never hear about the results.

I understand Jagex have a new CEO but his job isn't to lead the team responsible for designing and maintaining specifically Runescape's monetization model. That team has its own leadership, and to my knowledge, this leadership has not changed. **Its the same leadership which has designed and maintained the current model which was just acknowledged as a failure.**

* So why are Jagex doing this now rather than in the past?
* What has changed within the Runescape team specifically that has let this project finally move forward?
* And why should we expect a different outcome this time around?",2025-06-25 16:48:36,13

Ever since squeal, mtx has been an arms race in how much it could get people to gamble in order to earn in game rewards. It has actively been prioritized over desperately needed updates like the avatar refresh. There are far more options in Solomons store to buy for customizations than there are with gold, and several treasure hunter rewards over the years have gate kept cool items that should have been able to obtain elsewhere. The item redemption tokens are especially egregious of this. Also, it's dumb that there's multiple different stores in the game to buy mtx on such as the marketplace, solomons, loyalty shop, and even the oddements. 




Paying to win rewards only keeps people in the yard, but it wont get them to stay. I played briefly during corona but quickly saw just how damaged the entire game became over the years because of MTX, and I really don't think there's a way to salvage the current game without a clean reset. 




As it stands, while I used to love RuneScape before 2011, I tell people now that the game has long since become unplayable. 




Oh yeah, and in case a Jagex mod actually reads this, please release the versions of runescape music before they were orchestrated. OSRS music was not the last version of music before the orchestra. A guy called manpaint on youtube has all those tracks saved from a sound cache, but I have never been able to find a place where Jagex archived these publicly.",2025-06-25 22:25:00,7

This announcement is framed as building good-will, game integrity, working with players to find the right balance, feedback, etc… - but the bottom line is Jagex wouldn’t be making these changes at all if they believed MTX could still generate a large income for them. They’re noticing MTX income falling year on year and are now taking the gamble to reduce it/cut it out in hopes of bringing back players or appealing to new ones by following a model more similar to OSRS.

\- The cosmetic free worlds/toggleable cosmetics  
\- The second experiment sounds good for the economy, and help players to actually play the game again.

I hope Jagex also provides some tangeable data from the income side for the game for this (if they can). It would help players in understanding the impact from experiments, and why certain things are/aren't viable monetisation-wise.

the only thing that is giving me pause is the disabling of mtx related items, mainly portable stations since you did not mention looking into working them into the game naturally. The wording implies its an experiment to see how it goes with a complete removal and that's it. 

I would like to see all the benefits of portable stations come to in game facilities. I.e

portable range- 21% more Cooking experience, along with a 5% chance of doubling it

dwards the t3 fort grove bonus. There is zero reason to use the T3 range when portable ranges exist and are very cheap. Put those benefits into the T3 range

Also Portable wells- Put those benefits in T3 Bot or something since Poprtable wells makes herblore break even/profit even when leveling just due to the extra proc chances

Taking portable wells away with 0 alternative is going to shift the prices of alot of potions dramatically i feel like

Frankly it should've happened a long time ago. You've waited until the eleventh hour to make a decision. I hope RS3's reputation can be improved at this point, and I hope these experiments you've outlined are the shortest path to that. I remain optimistic.

XP handouts demoralise the community and intrude on the game's economy. Every lamp and protean devalues some player's time because it's a resource that hasn't been consumed. Dummies make mockery of gameplay and bring eyesore to the game. DXP events stopped being the celebration they once were. These problems are not irreversible.

I'll hazard a guess that the average player doesn't mind paid cosmetics as long as they're not obnoxious. Wings and huge pets come to mind as the offenders. We know you can do better.

For our sake and also for the company's sake, I hope Jagex digs RS3 out of this bad spot. I'd like to see RS3 thrive the way OSRS does. RS3 deserves resurgence.

Edit:

>Cosmetic Mega Drop: We will offer a large selection of past cosmetic overrides - including some previously only available via TH - for direct purchase all at once

I'll preface this by saying that I'm excited for these experiments regardless of my concerns, and think they're the right first step. The transition does feel extremely painful though -- let's dive into the experiments:

This is what everyone has been asking for, and I do think it's the right direction -- but it does feel bad for those who have Premier membership in large part _for_ the extra daily key. Also, while directly selling XP does sidestep the (subjective opinion) more predatory aspects of treasure hunter, it doesn't improve the game health. The only part of this experiment I'm fully behind is the capping of XP purchases per day.

DXP event with no XP items: This is a weird one, and the one I'm most frustrated by. I stockpile my resources to make an event of double XP and really cash in on the daily chores I do through the rest of my playtime. Double XP with proteans is how I can balance my desire to experience high-level content in RuneScape with my desire to have commitments in my life other than RuneScape. Having a big pool of fast XP that I have to slowly accumulate over 3 months is a good way to bring life some balance instead of grinding 24/7. I do like that we're stepping away from that ""fast XP"" being buyable with cash, but I don't like that we're losing out on the fast XP entirely. Maybe something like an enhanced version of the cinder core effect would make this more palatable?

Cosmetic Mega Drop: Personally, I'm happy with the cosmetics I have -- but I'm really really hoping that I'm in the minority. I love to see games supported by people's creativity and self-expression, especially in contrast to games supported by individuals buying their way to competitive advantage and power. I hope many people go wild on this and it proves to be a viable long-term income stream for Jagex.

Cosmetic-Free Worlds: I'm torn on this. I do like the idea of opting in to a more consistent aesthetic in the game, but I hate to reduce other people's player agency and, again, self-expression. Having these be opt-in is definitely the right call, and this concept feels close to great, but it'll need some massaging.

Whatever happens with these experiments, keep up this level of communication and transparency. We, the players, will support a company that levels with us. If the game is struggling for income, communicate that! Don't fall back to keeping us in the dark and relying on manipulative hero passes and MTX promotions.

Since I'm already going all over the place in this comment, one final thought -- I want to double down on what others have said in this thread. As bad as the microtransactions themselves is the clutter they induce. Runescape feels _bad_ to log in to initially because of the TH promos in your face, the solomon's store ad, etc. It's too much clutter, too much color, too much noise. Having an in-game store in high traffic areas (like the in-game solomon's store outside the GE, when the GE was higher traffic) is a much better solution.",2025-06-28 06:46:04,7

One possible issue that I see with the current lineup of experimentations - is the ""Cosmetic Mega Drop"" could be slightly inflated due to the Fear Of Missing Out (F.O.M.O) buyer's since this event focuses heavily on ""Past cosmetic overrides"" meaning that it could feel like these MTX options will only be available during this period and it could shift the scales.

I would honestly like to see this mega drop focus on newer unreleased MTX options, with the caveat that they will be available again at some point in the future, thus removing any FOMO.

I have played off and on the for the past few years now and had some fun but it is different knowing anyone around me may have purchased their levels and wealth. 

I myself am not immune to this. When I quit a gave away many items of value and when I returned I bought some bonds. While I have made much more then what I bought it did allow me to get back into things more easily. 

I think one of the best things RuneScape can do is offer a new version with no mtx, no multi account play, and no cosmetics. Or possibly a switch similar to the toggle for invention gizmos.

I have never purchased any MTX; I only use whatever proteans, lamps, stars, cosmetics, etc that I have gotten from my free daily spins. And I quite enjoy using these to help with leveling and some xp.

When I started in 2004 there was no MTX or any other ‘boosts’ to skills and training. E.g. 99 runecrafting for me was a 2 year, 3 hours a day grind – running between bank and altar for hours, w66 law company, double nat company, dodging PKers to get to the abyss to craft runes.  Technically Runespan ‘devalued’ the skill in that now it was much easier to get xp with less effort.  Now TH proteans have made the skill easier and faster.

But, do players now have 3 hours a day for 2 years to grind a skill (if proteans, lamps, stars etc thru TH were removed)?  Are players willing or able to dedicate a large amount of gameplay time to levelling and progressing skills the old-fashioned way? Would new and especially a younger generation of players be engaged enough to put the time and effort into levelling and training if there was no ‘quick’ option to get some xp to help with training?

I'm not saying to keep MTX the way it is or even to keep it at all.  But there does need to be a way to keep newer players engaged and wanting to progress skills without the big number of hours of grinding that we used to have.

After skillcapes were released, RS was overrun by bots. DIY became the way to train if you wanted to boycott botted resources and prove that you could gain levels through your own hard work.  Its now how Ironman works.  Apart from the GE and trading, I’m unsure how IM would differ from a normal account if MTX were removed. Just curious about this, as I like the way they require a different approach to the game at present.

I’m happy to be involved in these experiments, give my honest feedback, and see what happens.",2025-06-28 06:13:59,3

CEO's and directors unfortunately have had a *long* history in this game of promising less MTX and never following through or only doing the bare minimum so, i say as a 20 year veteran of this wonderful game we'll see i guess..

now me being a doomer aside, if i could supply some helpful feedback;

1. start relying more on runecoins or direct purchase more, players *will* buy cosmetics if they're available to them... hell iirc a good 30% of FFXIV's income is basically solely off the cash shop, and i'm pretty sure a similar ratio comes in for BDO's cash shop cosmetics. (mind you BDO does a lot of ah....stimulating, cosmetics so maybe not a great example lmao)
2.  th cosmetics need to eventually cycle to cash shop with ofc occasional promos to get them in game so players can buy with cash or GP. Look i'll be honest, i really hate th cosmetics because they tend to be fomo nightmares BUT, they can be done in a healthier manner, simply release them to a cash shop (say 5 bucks direct purchase for one or 9$ for 2+?)... TH i view as kind of a necessary evil as it *did* basically save RS when it was having major financial issues BITD but its long gotten out of hand ofc
3. GIVE US MORE KEEPSAKE SLOTS. seriously i'd drop my monthly fun money (about 100 bucks) here and now if you added 50 or even 100 more slots... keepsakes are an absolute goldmine for jagex
   1. sub point, add 6 perm slots for members (with a little golden keepsake key icon) and 2 for each tier of premier... easy money right there as some people will sub just to keep it
4. give us more ways to directly support jagex as a company with more merch! I know jagex doesn't have microsoft levels of money backing them like Xbox's various studios but you've got a player base that would love more merch or even old merch that's no longer sold (like the omen plushies) that would pay a fair bit for merch if offered
5. Reduce op blink and you'll miss it xp promos.... look i fall a bit in the middle on TH XP, I love the idea of bxp stars from just about any source as they still make me play the game, they just make unreasonable skills (agility, god i hate agility) more reasonable.... but direct xp items? Look you know there's a problem when there's like 8 or 9 different types of xp lamp that can only be won via MTX
   1. that said though, adding things like phoenix lamps as a weekly reward (scaled based on your levels) to things like the phoenix, or the hydra lamps as a purchasable reward from select minigames i think would be a welcome addition and spring some life back into some minigames (seriously if you could buy large celebration lamps from PC, it'd probably over night see a resurgence in play)   
6. last but not least, give us better methods of communication for feedback on this. too often it's either here on reddit (where it gets buried) or it's discord (...where it also gets buried lol).. Im not asking for a full runelabs just, maybe a monthly Q&A on twitch or something where feedback can be given and addressed or big mega threads on reddit here to collect it.

MTX has completely devalued RS3. The game’s progression, accomplishments, and even the community’s identity have been eroded by constant monetization. Skilling used to have meaning and social interaction — now it’s just XP lamps and keys.

Somewhere along the way, RS3 lost its sense of personality. It stopped feeling like a world you could get immersed in and started feeling more like a storefront. The challenge, the adventure, and the satisfaction of working toward something got replaced with quick profit.

I honestly think this change is only happening now because of how much OSRS has overtaken RS3. OSRS leads in player count, engagement, even Twitch viewership. And even if RS3 takes a hit, OSRS probably keeps the revenue stable.

Funny how RS3 used to help fund OSRS — and now it’s the other way around.

Can you give a yes or no on whether players joining the RS3 Leagues will be able to purchase any gameplay benefits that affect the game mode, or if it will be MTX free (or at least cosmetic only)? I see Leagues as the biggest chance to draw in new players this year, and I feel like a lot of OSRS players who are on the fence would make the plunge if they had a guarantee that their competition wouldn’t be affected by players spending real world money, like the second half of FSW.

Either way, I am hyped for the road ahead - and look forward to hopefully being a part of shaping it!",2025-06-25 20:17:02,4

Haven't seen anything positive like this since about 2000 with Archaeology.  I'm sure word is getting around of this news and hopefully we get more players returning.  I'm also hopefully it will greatly reduce the overall negativity surrounding RS3.

MTX experiment suggestions.

- XP/BXP shouldn't be sold.  We have so many ways to train to level 120 that we don't need it.  You should want people to subscribe to this game for 5+ years and slowly level up.

- Treasure Hunter deleted, total removal.  We should have a quest where Alice can meet the same fate as Yelps.

- Yak Track to return as Yak Tasks.  Similar mechanics as Area Tasks where players, from normal gameplay, end up passively completing them and in no particular order.  All tasks can be worked on at the same time (like Area Tasks/achievements).  Skips available for additional purchase.  Old Yak Tasks available for purchase years down the road for players that were not here when they were released or just tight on cash and can buy later.  Everyone has to pay 2 bonds for it, no free Yak Tasks as that would break the model I'm suggesting.

- Make sure cosmetics are not sold too expensively, the last batch just cost way too much.  Focus on selling to a lot of players for a low price than to a few players for a high price.

- Loyalty Shop rework, make auras available in-game!",2025-06-25 21:20:48,4

One “experiment” I always wanted to see so I will suggest it here: Remove all mtx outside of bonds. (Basically how osrs does it). If players want faster xp rates, GET BOND -> sell for gp -> use gp to buy skilling supplies that give fast but expensive xp (like cutting dragonstones or fletching dragon darts).

Cosmetics would be added to a special drop table (or clues etc), so if you want a cosmetic, someone has to get it as a drop, sell it on GE and you buy it for gp from them. You already did something similar with black party hats.

The overwhelming interfaces discourages new players and clean up the tooltips / popups tutorials, make it more basic.

Start by automatically asking two questions

1. do you want legacy or ability combat
2. do you want a legacy interface or a default basic one.

Having these as a pop up will remove alot of the overwhelming feeling, especially for people returning from osrs. IT throws alot of them off.

One option could be to default legacy interface / combat until the player is done with being introduced to the game then offer an option or ease the player in to using some abilities as a stepping stone. So by ease i mean, you kill an NPC with an ability popup in your special action slot to show it's benefits and difference whilst remaining in legacy combat / interface to show the difference between the two.

Removing MTX is a massive win for the community, i completely agree with reducing the impact on DXP of MTX skilling items but Jagex also needs to consider how complex and overwhelming the early game can be.

I know, I know, saying ""HEy I'd spend more money if X"" is usually a bad idea to say to companies, but man the cosmetics in RS are just so..... *gaudy*. Like I wouldn't be against maybe ""legacy cosmetics"" being able to be usable, stuff that you had to unlock in-game, but seeing players running around in beachwear or as snowmen or whatever just makes it REALLY hard to take RS seriously at times. Personally, I think the only two cosmetics I have active at this point, are my glove slot and my cape. 

  
Another idea that could be beneficial is to integrate some MTX content into in-game reward spaces or similar areas. Like, for example, an invention or a fort machine that processes raw resources into tradable protean items.  

  
If you must keep some degree of MTX to help fund RS, it shouldn't be gamble-y stuff. For example, selling tiers of ""unlocked"" characters, i.e., a character with level 30-50-70 stats. I wouldn't go any higher than that, but it could be an option. I also personally don't have a problem with XP stars, because you still need to actually engage with a skill to utilize that BXP. Solomon store should ACTUALLY be used for once.

  
I will also say this: the writing has been on the wall. We all see the data that MTX sales are decreasing, RS player goodwill is decreasing, and lastly, gambling and MTX laws are slowly encroaching, it would have been stupid to have continued on, so I will be cautiously optimistic that this isn't just another ""we're sorry"" statement that leads to no major changes.",2025-06-25 17:55:16,2

During this time, I have not played more than 25 hours across both OSRS and Runescape. 

I have tried to get into Runescape dozens of times over my life. Every time I tried OSRS, it always seemed ""archaic"", I didn't have the nostalgia factor to draw me in, the graphics always kind of put me off (Coming from World of Warcraft), and the combat was different from what I was used to. 

Now that I am getting older, with more commitments and responsibilities, Runescape seems like the perfect game that I would love to get into. I like the gameplay loop, the passiveness, skills, crafting, player market, collectables, etc. I see people post photos of themselves getting to 99 in a particular skill and I feel so happy and proud of them, it shows that they put in the time and commitment to accomplish an impressive achievement.

This is in addition to a developer that hosts elections for players to vote what is/isn't added to the game and listens to feedback in some capacity.

However, as a new player researching Runescape, you're confronted with an ugly truth. 

""You can purchase skill levels through microtransactions""

To me, this removes any and all incentive to commit to 'the grind'. Knowing that the guy next to me could have bought his way through the skill levels that would take me hours, if not days, to accomplish. Every time I make a new runescape account, I really enjoy it for the first few hours, but I am then shown with ads for premium and bonds and it brings up that line I mentioned before, ""You can purchase skill levels through microtransactions"" and I immediately am turned off from exploring the world any further. 

I'll end it with this, I am not opposed to mtx in games (looking at you WoW/Destiny), but when those mtx influence and impact the core gameplay loop, that is when it becomes an issue. I will be keeping an eye on Runescape over the next few months, and I hope that one day I'll be able log in and purchase my membership to explore the world that eluded me for so long.",2025-06-25 18:09:29,2

The cosmetic dump seems like it will have misleading results because it is offering currently unobtainable items that have inherent demand. Selling a specific new cosmetic directly, and for actual cash instead of rune coins, would be a far better way to test engagement and demand for future cosmetic releases.

These experiments are a nice start but they are flawed and designed to benefit profits more than sate player demands.",2025-06-25 18:52:03,2

MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,mzr4wke,OG_Xero,"Hi, I'm a returning player from 15+ years ago, and I have input on this that I believe is valuable to what's being done.

I'll have a few comments on the article itself, and some responses.

1st. the experiments look horrible for pretty much anyone.  
""**Disabling Treasure Hunter:** We will turn off Treasure Hunter, instead offering bundles of Stars and Knowledge Bombs for direct purchase (capped at 1 bundle per day)""  
\-Not bad, honestly, even the mtx themselves aren't bad, but this removes rewards for playing the game. Perhaps only disable the ability to purchase keys, not the keys you earn in-game from dailies etc. bonds can still be used to buy members, so they have a use.

2nd. ""**DXP Event With Only Bonus XP Available:** We will disable the use of Proteans, Dummies, Lamps and other skilling items available via MTX entirely in our Autumn DXP\*""  
\-Proteans are being saved until DXP weekends... so you are invalidating the use of them for that and less people will save them up...and people will almost always turn them into something else like lamps for quicker xp or other items.  
\- If anything, protean items are ideal for DXP, and removing them from TH and have them be earned in-game is a better option, you skill? you get skilling items rewarded via some new currency in-game that can instead buy proteans for tickets or something.

3rd.""**Cosmetic Mega Drop:** We will offer a large selection of past cosmetic overrides - including some previously only available via TH - for direct purchase all at once""  
\-I don't mind this, and honestly if I were financially able to afford them, I might even join... maybe even still will get a thing or two, but there are very few cosmetics i'm interested in outside of weapon cosmetics.... and it'd be really silly to offer a party hat cosmetic for a really expensive price... though i'm sure people would def. use it.  
\-that being said...., perhaps change TH to award the cosmetic items in a different way, so TH itself isn't completely useless, and you can still earn things in-game.

4th. I like cosmetic free worlds, give me and everyone else 1 more bonus though.... banner free grand exchanges... seeing a banner shouting someone's 2 quest points is insanely annoying (also side bonus, maybe move skilling area to the top of the exchange and don't allow them to be used in the bottom, so that area can stay clear :)) (edit: cosmetic free worlds should disable ability to hide armor/weapons!)

5th. Personally, I don't mind MTX, but it's clear that it hurts the game, and 'you guys, jagex' complained about adding money into the game via mtx but then introduce a 250m TH.... that was really weird. It sounds like you're working on it though. :)

6th. I missed a lot of the events... life happened, other games, etc etc.  
I missed gold party hats, black party hats, new santa hats, and a bunch of other things... but that's not my point here, my point is that some of those event exclusives could be brought back, in a members only area, to promote others purchasing membership.

7th. From when i played, 10m was a lot of money, not a ton, but still a lot.  
now, 10m is given away frequently enough that it might as well be 10-100k, because you can't do much with it.  
there are tons of cosmetics improperly labeled with costs (bunny ear for pets says 110m, but isn't traded enough to have a real price).

The main thing I see as an issue, is that you can make more money without actually skilling, buy everything and maybe lose a little gp here and there... , almost punishing those who actually go out and level up skills...

but I digress, skilling changes here and there and it's not a huge deal... 

  
Overall, thanks for looking into mtx issues, I don't think protean is a huge issue, even for dxp... but TH even... isn't that big of an issue, the issue is letting people buy keys, like a lottery... giving the game a horrible look from the outside.

That being said... TH is only an issue because it's cosmetics that are essentially a paywall... and the only reason people buy keys, is to get a chance at those billion dollar items that are added... quick money that gives you more than the 100-130M from buying and selling a bond.

Bonds are great, perhaps having some of those in TH instead of big money, with more of a chance for a drop would be better.",2025-06-25 19:33:00,2

Quit because it was MTX fest.

The change of Treasure Hunter promotions being somewhat of a system which require players to put in some input (for example Assassin contracts), to a system today with ultra-rare items and some promotions where even free and daily oddment keys aren’t enough to buy an outfit - it became a system where we’re now forced to buy keys beyond to complete customisations. It wasn’t nice from a consumer perspective when the ability to earn them was taken away.

This, in combination of the Hero Pass debacle, was when I started to not only lose interest but also lose respect for Jagex. Hero Pass felt more personal, because it was a blatant attempt to instantly capitalise on players returning for Necromancy, instead of riding the player count boom which comes with a new skill. This is coming from a die hard Scaper, someone who still plays on the same account since 2005, and someone who despite its flaws, still loves this IP to death and has so many fond memories which I’ll never forget.

I hope this is the start of a new era for RuneScape. It deserves it. It’s such a beautiful, unique world which has been beaten down due to its shoddy MTX design which, no matter how amazing an update was, it always had the dark cloud of MTX overshadowing it. I don’t think it’s too late to change, it’s never too late. I’m just sad that it has taken this long for the words “MTX is harming RuneScape” to be acknowledged and said. A pleasant surprise was the test of cosmetic-free servers, I think we all remember the “drab” comment an MTX J-Mod said on stream when it was brought up years ago, and how it wasn’t feasible.

I think overall the game has a lot of great direction, a lot of things I like, but there are still some snagging points for new, old, and returning players.

- MTX has done some real damage. Even after it is gone (if that is the direction things head) then the shadow will still loom over the game for some time to come, eventually things will heal as new players come in hopefully and progress, but maybe some kind of high scores refresh or opt-in ""fresh start"" could be a thing. Expanding on the opt-in ""fresh start"" it could be an option for a limited time to reset your account back to square 1, this would give you access to a new set of high scores and maybe these players could get special rewards like in FSWs. On top of this you could make a new set of high-scores so the old ones would be archived and the new high scores for ""post-MTX"" would begin. I say this because personally I wouldn't restart my whole account, I have been playing since ~2008 and have stuck with RS3 the whole time, and have grown quite attached to my account

- Combat is messy. Necro is a great step in the right direction, it is far easier to use than the other 3 combat styles though. It honestly shows a point i've talked about to friends before, that Necro was clearly designed *for* EoC while the original styles are worked into EoC and honestly for combat to feel better it needs an EoC 2.0 or something, where the skills are re-worked to be all in-line with how necro is.

- MMOs aren't as popular nowadays... It sucks but it is true that MMO's just aren't the ""in"" thing anymore, OSRS is probably the singular most popular non-eastern MMO (I cannot speak for eastern MMOs because I don't play any). Now I cannot speak for OSRS players, but IMO I think a large part of appeal to games like RS are 2 things; AFK-ability, and Simplicity. I think finding some way to make the game have an easier early flow for new players would be a huge boon. For a long time now the game has done a lot for the end-game and high end players (which is great for us players at the top) but think about the last major update for F2P or the last major update to add stuff for below level 60. The game needs to really look at the new and low level player experience if it wants to grow, on top of the MTX changes.

I think RS3 can become a great game, that OSRS and RS3 can both grow to be top-tier MMOs is a possible option IMO. I think that above all though it requires a look at the new-player experience, a potential combat rework, and regaining old players trust. The fact stands that I have seen the sentiment of ""I'll believe it when I see it"" about all this, and it really shows the player attitude that hearing such big news like this is met with scepticism. I think Runescape can more than bounce back, that it can grow to be as big as OSRS personally it won't be an easy road. Game health updates for like a year might be a realistic option in terms of growing and keeping players even post-MTX, although without MTX possibly there could be room for a game-health team that focuses on fixing new-player experience, gaining trust with old players (working on long-standing issues like bugs, balance, etc).",2025-06-26 02:41:41,3

> We want to PLAY the game.

Many of the TH updates over the years have whittled the core gameplay elements of RuneScape down to relying on DXP, Proteans, and other major XP handouts. 

Even new GAMEPLAY content feels like it has its day in the sun for a short period before the TH meta eventually finds a way to devalue it. 

Whilst I welcome the experiments, I worry that we're still not addressing the concerns of direct XP bonuses coming from TH that reduce the overall burden of GAMEPLAY input on players. 

RuneScape has always been a bit of a grind and slog fest compared to other MMOs. Whilst natural creep is expected, there is a lot of content added from TH that can be repurposed and added as gameplay content, e.g. earning Silverhawk Feathers ala Marks of Grace from doing Agility laps.

My fear is we've not just passed the point of no return on this crazy cliff edge, but we're actually already hurtling towards the ground. 3 Months of experiments and then what?

There's been times when I wanted just the cosmetic, but it wasn't even an option. I know the intent is to upsell, but it can easily turn into buy all this crap you don't want or need and we'll give you what you want as a bonus.

With the avatar rework back off the shelf, I'd like to see an updated cosmetic override/character wardrobe interface. Like viewing 8 items on the screen at once is terrible. And now there's like 60 tabs to scroll through on some of the items, with the number always growing. And there's a lag on loading them in, at least on my end. A reevaluation of recolors, prismatics, dyes, etc going forward would be welcome too.

A unified cosmetic store would be welcome. Solomon's and The Marketplace could/should be merged imo. And it suffers similar issues as the cosmetic wardrobe interface.

Still not even a huge fan of selling bundles of stars and bombs. Can studies not be done to see who is buying all this XP and what for? Like which skills, skill levels, etc? If the core issue is a specific skill(s) or level gaps, can we not just address that instead of ruining the game integrity for profit? Or if it's simply new accounts or players boosting alts through the early game, take look number 47 at revamping the 'new player experience' or maybe even we do just need to look into selling pre-leveled/boosted accounts.

I couldn't handle constantly being sold things after having bought my subscription. I'm already drenched in marketing manipulations and ads irl and also on the rest of the internet. And so I pay a subscription for escapism and enjoyment (RuneScape) and I end up with the same things there, *still* telling me that I'm not spending enough money? Pop-ups, things only accessible if I spend more and more, limited-time FOMO.. 

If I hop into this game and see all those things gone, (gosh I *REALLY* hope so, this game was something so meaningful to me) I would jump right back in - yearly memberships, and catch up on those beautiful quests.. I can't wait to see the lore and what the writers have been up to! I'd start getting my friends involved in the game and meet them at lummy or GE, guide them through quests, maybe even buy them memberships and bond with them there.

This game hit me so hard in the past that I completely stopped playing games altogether. I'm only recently trying things again after 7 years of quitting, I truly hope this isn't some half-assed statement. But mostly, I *truly* hope you don't manipulate yourselves with your own questionnaire/experiment results. 

* 60% of ex-players felt that microtransactions detracted from their experience of the game
* 63% of ex-players said they would be more likely to return if we address key concerns with XP-related MTX

With things like this, I fear that you may use some form of weaponised incompetence and be like ""We'll remove/reduce the XP-related MTX, expect the player returns, but we're going to *massively* boost the number of pop-ups/MTX notifs, or add different types of MTX, or whatever"".

I'll be honest. My deadline for this statement, was early next week. If it didn't happen by then I would have probably dipped out of the game for a good few years. 

But just opening with MTX has been harmful is very promising. But. A lot of the damage TH has done, is done. Billions of experience don't unexperience themselves. It's a good start but nothing is going to change overnight. Even if things happen perfectly.

My personal opinion for things like proteans, skilling dummies, portables, even pulse cores. Make them invention items. Each would sink a signifigant amount of materials, and still allow people to train in a very lax afk way. Pulse cores, maybe divination? but to make you have to sacrifice experience in a skill.

That's why Solomon's Store is chill and something most people are okay with. Because while you can purchase the cosmetics with real money, if you like you can also spend a big chunk of ingame cash to buy bonds and purchase the cosmetic with those. Jagex still gets their money at the end of the day from whoever purchased the bond, and people like myself who don't want to spend $$ on MTX are happy.

Also with regards to Treasure Hunter, I think there should ideally be two separate tests - removing TH entirely, and removing the ability to purchase keys. I think the daily challenges have been part of mainscape for so long now that there's a good chance some people actually respond poorly to it being completely removed, and I don't want that to then be used as justification to just keep it as is - when really if purely the MTX aspect of it (key sales) was removed those same people would have been delighted.

I understand that makes sense from a company point of view because it pushes the numbers up. But I've heard so often that people liked playing Ironman in RS3 but the dailies drove them to burnout. For many players the keys are nothing other than dailies. Both Runescape 3 and OSRS are so good at giving you the feeling that you can come back after a break because your progress still counts. But RS3 has the problem that you feel like you've missed out on an infinite number of overpowered ""free"" items and XP. In old school you can just take a break for a few months or years, come back and everything still counts, only new items have been released that you still have to earn. For me, from the point of view of someone who doesn't buy keys, daily challenges for 3 extra keys and further daily weekly and monthly  are another point that devalues ​​progress.

How do you plan on handling data from this for people just waiting? If we know that the next DXP isn't using MTX but the one right after it is, won't people just be incentivized to not engage with DXP since it's only a 3 month wait to use dummies and proteans? With how frequent DXP is, it's not even a particularly long wait for massively higher/cheaper XP gains. 

I worry that you will essentially get data that shows that people won't engage with the game if you remove MTX, when it's actually just waiting for the existing pause to be removed, but a longer experiment might show that people re-engage with content because it isn't worth waiting (especially if you don't know the date it will come back/if it's coming back at all).",2025-06-25 18:49:42,1

However, I think the biggest thing that's going to get in the way of bringing many OSRS players over is the disparity between players who were able to benefit from MTX before its removal and everyone else who didn't. I can see a lot of people (myself included) still consider it too big of a bridge to gap to come back in any way other than an Ironman, which already removed most of these issues outside of cosmetics. 

Would there be any consideration given to special worlds which only allows characters who didn't engage in p2w MTX to migrate, or some other alternative that separates players coming in under these new systems from those who took advantage of the old ones? I'd probably still come back as an ironman if I could reset my character (though I'm a little averse to doing that because I've heard some people who request that through customer support end up having their OSRS character wiped instead), but on the OSRS subreddit there's plenty of people who don't want to engage with an economy and a community that will have had the ability to pay to get an exorbitant lead over them.

Other than that, on an individual level, first thoughts on the monthly experiments:

July - removing treasure hunter (outside of stars & bombs): A good start, but I can see members who don't engage in p2w still holding off on playing the game outside of DXP events, assuming this was a long-term change. It doesn't fix the underlying p2w issues, just lessens the bankstanding nature of them.

August - DXP with no MTX: Much better, but again, has the issue of people leaving outside of DXP. What I'd like to see is some way for your engagement during a DXP event to reward you outside of DXP - whether that's through some decaying XP boost that tapers off until the next DXP (or maybe even 1.5x xp?) event, or some other reward (knowledge bombs?).

September - Cosmetics: Honestly I don't care too much about this either way, I'm not a big fan of cosmetic mtx but I can deal with however they're implemented. However, if a filtering system is being considered for disabling viewing them, it'd be nice if the cosmetics were given tags and those tags were what could be filtered - that way we can disable the 'silly' cosmetics, or 'wings', or... etc.

Long before the Squeal of Fortune and the monster that it has evolved into today. I’ve seen my fair share of articles such as this as well as the attempts to remove or lessen MTX over the years such as the abysmal Hero Pass. Simply put, I’ll believe it when I see it. 

The upper tiers of management in this company obviously want to maximize profits as much as possible. It’s like that for any company on the planet. We already have had membership prices increase across the board. Sure, that can be attributed to the continuing content drops we receive which makes sense. As for MTX, that is just free money they are receiving which I assume is driving a vast majority of your profit margins. 

These experimental ideas are pretty decent compared to what we’ve seen in the past, but I don’t see the upper management fully approving an almost full MTX wipeout. That will significantly destroy the profits they’re seeing, which will end up hurting the game in the long run whether that be it being sold off to the next buyer or drastically reduced content expansions. 

I personally think the season pass concept works just like it does it most other games. However I think the method that you guys went about it with the originally Hero Pass was flawed. We simply need a 1-100 (or 200 if split between 6 month periods) and progress is gained simply through ANY XP gain. XP from skilling, quest completions, boss kills, etc. No task system or anything like we had prior or how the daily’s work. You can then throw in cosmetic items, BXP items, etc into the pass and that’s the only way you get that stuff. If the pass system has worked for so many other games of different genre types, I don’t see why it couldn’t work for this game in a simplified manner.",2025-06-25 19:23:15,1

Bit unfortunate that they've decided to bring in the no MTX for the next dxp (as my premier ends in october, and the new prices just don't work well with life). Since life also no longer cooperates with super grindy stuff (and as someone who got max combat before EOC, I've definitely been though the grind), I had a heap or proteans saved, so it does feel like quite a big loss for the skills that I don't like doing (I'm looking at you hunter and runecrafting).

Getting rid of RNG in MTX is basically the top demand for players to start buying MTX. Lessening the gameplay impact of MTX is a big demand for players tolerating MTX in game. An unexpected nice part is rereleasing limited time items, which is a great step away from FOMO. Before I get into criticisms and feedback, I want to reiterate that I like these changes and this plan.

To players, put your money where your mouth is. If you like the new MTX, engage with it. It's funny how many people say they would pay a higher subscription but then don't consider just buying some MTX instead.

The main thing holding me back personally is confidence that a large portion of the funds raised by MTX are actually going to be reinvested into the game. I'm hesitant to spend more on the game if a lot of it is just going to line a rich guy's pocket. This is something that is not addressed at all in the announcement. It kind of make sense when viewed through the lens of catering to players' demands to increase profits.

The XP side of things seems a little weak. Using proteans on DXP is just the tip of the XP iceburg. Stars and lamps are a lot more direct and using proteans off DXP is also very significant. This is where things will get very complicated and may very well end in an impasse. It's hard to make any MTX that will have any degree of useful gameplay benefit when it seems like a lot of people hardline against that.

On a related note, I find the ""competitive advantage"" argument silly. Runescape is not directly competitive. If players have a competition, they can self regulate to disallow MTX. It would also help if MTX disqualified players from relevant achievements. e.g. the 10% Zammy damage reduction would prevent that kill from granting any achievements. If there was an enrage high score, you would unlock an enrage but it wouldn't count towards your high score.

One thing I thought of that might be cool as an MTX bundle would be starter packs. Here's a cool pickaxe that scales to level 90 and comes with a cosmetic override. You can equip it but you can't put it on your toolbelt and can't augment it. You could do the same thing with other tools. You could also do it with weapons and armor, but the scaling would have to cut off around level 70 so it doesn't compete with significant mid to late game weapons.

It sounds like the right people have a decent understanding of the situation. Here's hoping the plan works out and MTX can be adjusted to find a more healthy place in the game.",2025-06-30 17:57:49,1

They need to have a set window for how long content has been out to be moved over to f2p or even just it's relevance to members, like if something is hardly touched by members anymore it should be made available to f2p. on top of this the price for members is simply way too much and every time i check back it has gone up even more, sure the cost of new content is more expensive to make but the older stuff wasn't and newer members and people who haven't been a member for a very long time won't be touching  that content for months or even years so the cost of entry for members is too much. I can't justify the cost of members at all nor can i afford it on top of all the other things i HAVE to pay for that keep getting higher and higher. Keep the price for members as high as it is and enjoy having very few people paying for it or drop the price so significantly more people can afford to buy into it.

The amount members costs is just not worth it, i can play plenty of other mmos with far higher production costs that cost as much or even less than this game does and that is a huge problem. I can pay like $60 and get all the expansions to ESO that i can play anytime i want without having to pay a cent more where as here i have to pay $100 a year and once that year is up i lose access to pretty much everything, i can't even use the gear it earned or made while being a member and even if i was far enough where i could play everything new as soon as it came out there simply isn't enough content in a 1 year span to justify the price. Move to an expansion model or significantly cut subscription cost to be at most $60 a year like it was back in the day. This game was absolutely huge when it cost $5 a month but every time they jacked up the price the more people started leaving, the microtransactions themselves are not the biggest issue here for why nobody is playing this game anymore, sure it plays a part but most players jumped ship long before microtransactions started being a thing.

If a new player joins the game and finishes up with everything in f2p and decides to be a member they wouldn't be able to play ANYTHING released in the last decade within that year unless they are an every day player which very few people are, it will take years for the average person nowadays who can only playing a few hours a few nights a week to get to anything even remotely new so why should they pay for the higher production cost when the stuff they are playing is ancient?

So again, don't look at monetization, look at the price of membership and what is available to f2p players and what new and really old players who stopped playing a decade ago are getting for that $100 a year subscription. Look at letting people pay a single time fee for batches of content. Make anything older than like 5 years available for free to everyone and then start charging like $50 a year for everything release that year after that point and once they pay that $50 for that year's content they have it forever, they don't have to keep paying to access it. Make members a separate thing, charge like $10 a month and have special perks that are available while subscribed. Like ESO for example gives access to a crafting bag that holds all crafting mats among other things including being able to play anything but the newest expansion. In Lotro for example you can earn Lotro point for doing different achievements in the game that can be used for things in the cash shop including past expansion content while the newest expansion is real money only and the sub fee is similar to ESO where you get access to all but the newest content along with other perks.

Runescape is simply stuck in ancient times when mmos required a monthly fee and that just isn't how it works anymore outside of the biggest mmos like WoW and FF14, Runescape isn't WoW or FF14 so stop acting like it is.

This is coming from someone who has been playing this game on and off since classic, i love this game but the cost for members isn't worth it compared to other games and on top of this they charge even more on top of that ridiculous monthly fee that offers virtually nothing compared to most of the games.",2025-07-01 01:50:18,1

 keep the mtx cosmetics, (though maybe a little less aggressive?) I don't think they're too bad on there own (besides the way its presented, I mean come on guys Solomon is right there! we can make the mtx less intrusive and lore friendly!)  
 but the fact that there's a monthly fee to fully enjoy the game on top of the excessive pleads for more money is just a bit insulting.

now I know what youre going to say.

I know, trust me, I know the things ive done to get that monthly fee was enough to make my therapist need therapy

The truth is, Runescape at its core is a good game,(i mean honestly guys bravo, you really put your foot in this game!) that itself attracts people and will keep them playing!( and paying! people actually like the cosmetics as im sure these test will show) its the reason why people are willing to pay membership just to play osrs!

Players: ""But Rell, I pay good money to access those membership worlds! why should some freeloader get free that i spent hard earned money for!""

and to that my answer is this. look around the world its dead! we need more people to play with, more people to raid with (and more noobs to take stuff from)   
this world is too vast and too beautiful to be gatekept (literally I remember a literal gate blocking member areas way back when) and it could be so much better with a bigger population!  
to quote a world renowned under appreciated genius ""Its even better in a group!""

It's an insult to those who have had to grind skills for hours on end. Though, I would suggest retaining the ability to buy Member with GP directly and not through bonds.

I just came back to RS3 after not being active in this game for a good decade (main account is nearing 20 years old). Treasure Hunter was the start of when RS started to go downhill. Seeing how much bonus XP I am able to receive in such a short period of time is insane. I unlocked Necromancy through questing and was able to level up to 40 solely through prismatic lamps specifically. It's insane just how easy it is to gain XP in a skill without actually grinding it. Like, what's the point of even playing a game if the XP is literally handed to us on a silver platter?

At the end of the day I want to feel the rush of excitement of reaching milestones, but not like this.",2025-07-02 16:19:57,1
MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,n10bzd1,NeighborhoodCold6540,"I played runescape for years, since its inception, and I ended up quitting when squeal of fortune came out. To be fair, I also felt at the time that I had done everything I felt was worth doing in the game, but I was very upset about mtx being added. 

I came back one time before now, when the queen black dragon was released, and quit again because the combat system was just not very enjoyable to me at the time and I had other games to play. 

From my perspective back then, EOC and MTX destroyed the runescape I loved and I didn't want to spend the time it would take to start over in OSRS. (As much fun as it might be, I viewed being forced to start over as unfair)
When I came back, I feel the same way about starting over, so I tried rs3 again. Unfortunately, I just don't get the same sense of community that I used to get. Maybe its my fault for not joining a clan or something, but I remember striking up conversations with people and having a much more relaxed playstyle previously. Maybe I'm just not making the effort, but in many ways it feels like the rs3 community is just non existant compared to what it once was. I remember the old cwars days where everyone was laughing and having a good time, and joking around a ton, and just playing for fun, not for the grind. I miss that runescape. The grind has never been what makes runescape great, it has always been the community.

As a UX designer, if I were to say how to fix RS3, I would say a massive overhaul on the UX interface for overlays.  It is far too clunky and not intuitive at all. As far as new players are concerned, maybe give better starting action bars? Looking up action bars and implementing them, and then tying each weapon type to an action bar is nice for veterans, but a chore for new players. Maybe have action bars for each class that automatically switches when you switch weapons, and updates when you level up or gain a new skill. (That can be modified or disabled later). Maybe the max dps ones from the wiki for both dual wielding and 2h for each class?

I know when I first started again, I had to do research on many of the different interface buttons and how to turn them on/off. Auto retaliate button on mobile for example. I accidentally turned it off by tapping it, and had no idea how or why it was happening. Turns out its a tiny little sword icon at the bottom of the screen. 

I do miss the simplicity of the old combat system sometimes. But I do understand how EOC makes for much more complex boss mechanics. I just wish it was more enjoyable. I have always been one to strategize and find the best possible equipment and skill combos, but I just haven't experienced the joy of that in the runescape combat system.  I also absolutely hate the idea of locking skills behind a 500 million gp codex. I feel like I will actually never get to experience the full lvl 99 range experience in rs3, simply because I don't have billions of gp for gear/codices. Locking high end content behind a grind wall is a very runescape thing to do, but I just feel like it isn't obtainable without a super lucky drop, or high level bossing. And I dont have the time to fight bosses for 12 hrs in a row.",2025-07-02 20:44:18,1

I´d NOT be happy, if I can´t use my keepsakes at all. I think, cosmetics are just a problem if they don´t fit the theme of the game, so instead of removing cosmetics, don´t make bad cosmetics that are not medieval/fantasy related.

That said, I do have a piece of constructive feedback regarding their implementation.

Please consider the decision not to disable keepsaked items on these worlds.

Keepsaked items are not purely cosmetic MTX rewards; they are actual in-game physical items that players have earned or acquired through legitimate gameplay. The keepsake system was originally intended to allow players to preserve the look and feel of their gear without sacrificing function or stats. Although I do understand doing so may seem like it may miss the mark or dilute what those worlds are truly trying to accomplish.

I completely understand and support the idea of removing flashy, immersion-breaking elements—things like oversized wings, glowing auras, particle effects, or loud cosmetics from MTX promotions. Those are the real culprits when it comes to visual clutter and immersion loss. But most keepsaked items aren’t those things. They’re often subtle, lore-rich, legacy armors or pieces with personal value and relevance to the player experience—especially for skillers, who value visual expression during low-intensity gameplay.

From a skiller’s perspective, I don't believe wearing a keepsaked Grace of the Elves, or a trimmed skillcape, undermines the intent of cosmetic-free worlds. If anything, it enhances the vibe and aligns with the aesthetic RuneScape was originally built on and what these worlds would be designed to do. If the concern is more PvM-focused—such as in group bossing environments where identifying gear matters—then perhaps the restriction could be targeted to combat situations or PvM-specific locations. But if the goal of these new worlds is to give players a cleaner, more immersive visual space overall, then excluding all keepsaked gear feels unnecessarily heavy-handed.

I'm open to being corrected if I’m misunderstanding the technical or philosophical reasoning behind the restriction. But I do believe there’s a meaningful distinction between MTX cosmetics and legacy gear that has simply been keepsaked for convenience. That nuance matters, and I hope it’s taken into account.

In the past couple of months (not June, see below) I think I have spent around $60 on MTX in RuneScape ( I can go look up the actual numbers if I need to.) I play RS3. I have played since classic, 2003.

I understand the game needs revenue to fund content creation and basic maintenance, to ensure there are enough employees to actually keep the game functional on the backend.

I have been fine with the way things are so long as the MTX rewards remain either cosmetic or small enough to not upset the balance of the game. So, basically I am an advocate for the status quo.

I have watched what has happened with other games that went too far with MTX, like Gaia Online (not really a game, but it has a game-like element to it.) They destroyed their community by causing hyperinflation and putting good items out of reach unless a player was willing to spent a significant amount of real money. Advertisements for buying Premium Items were out of control and they would pop-up on every page, further enraging players and pushing them away. The hyperinflation collapsed the market and players fled by the droves and now the whole website is like a ghost town. Lesson: People want to feel like valued community members, not consumers that are only there to provide a revenue stream for contemptuous management.


I will say as a member of the LGBTQ community I was upset at the CEO's decision to scrap Pride events this month. Because of that I have decided not to spend any money on MTX this summer. I see that decision to scrap Pride as a capitulation to bigots, but thankfully existing Pride content is still in the game.


RuneScape is my home. My husband and I met on RuneScape and we just celebrated our 11th wedding anniversary. I have met so many interesting people on RuneScape, some that are now lifelong friends. I don't ever see myself leaving unless I die, but if it turns into a game where I feel more like a faceless wallet to contemptuous profit-motivated owners and no longer like a valued community member, I - and I'm sure many others - will find a better place that meets our needs.

**MTX is only part of the issue.**

Due in large part to bad updates which have been made over the years, this version of RuneScape just feels too alien for me to return to. I have a lot of reasons for this:

* December 10th 2007 was horribly handled from a PR perspective, had Wilderness PKing replaced with really bad and blatantly-rushed alternative content and the game still has scars of this awful string of updates as a result.
* The RuneScape 3 rebranding and ""Sixth Age God Wars"" bullshit that followed ruined the game from a lore perspective. A good example is the once-iconic meadow that separated Draynor Village and Lumbridge, which became a crater to host a Saradomin vs Zamorak duel where the loser would effectively be exiled from the game world. Spoiler alert: >!it was Zamorak.!<
* Evolution of Combat invalidated many of the systems that made RS3's economy work. Special attacks became irrelevant, making the cost of many weapons go into freefall. Also, you no longer needed tonnes of ammunition or runes to deal consistent ranged/magic damage, effectively killing Fletching and Runecrafting as money-makers.
* On top of this, EoC messed with the combat levels of mobs so drastically, that Deadly Red Spiders of all mobs became some of the most efficient in the game to farm for XP!
* Some of the graphical updates to old zones really missed the mark. The TzHaar overhaul that came with the Fight Kiln for example now just makes them look like generic rock monsters in a shitty mobile game. OSRS on the other hand got the Inferno, a full expansion to what is now known as Mor-Ul-Rek (still unimaginatively called the TzHaar City in RS3), and all while maintaining the awesome original 2005-era design of the zone and species.
* Revolution and Legacy Combat suck because you can't really reverse the damage that EoC did to the game by adding back modes of combat which suboptimally dial back the experience. Part of the reason DarkScape died and Deadman Mode succeeded was because DS was Legacy-only, even though the content within DS was designed around EoC.
* Menu & icon bloat. It's not as bad as it was a few years ago, but when I just logged back into RS3 after a several year hiatus and hit M to open the world map, holy shit what I saw was a readability nightmare of icon spam.
* Lodestones also harmed Runecrafting, which relegated teleport spells to little more than ways to escape from combat. But the biggest hit to the skill was the Runespan which became by far the most efficient and braindead way to train the skill.
* This is meant to be the flagship version of RuneScape, yet the RS3-exclusive content sucks. OSRS has two exclusive continents (Zeah and Varlamore) and three raids (Chambers of Xeric, Tombs of Amascut and Theatre of Blood.) RS3 on the other hand has only one raid accessed via a portal on a dead boar god's corpse floating near the River Lum's basin that takes you to a fucking desert planet full of humanoid turtles. And don't get me started on the low quality of Menaphos and the new skills/post-99 skill expansions introduced in RS3.
* Power creep is absolutely a problem with the game's content, especially with the sheer amount of T75, T80, T85, T90, T92, T95, T100.. etc content being added.
* Some of the features/content added to RS3 feel like dumb ideas implemented in an attempt to pander to common community suggestions, i.e. the Queen Black Dragon, Kalphite King, dual wielding, etc.

But going back to the MTX. It goes far beyond Treasure Hunter. Remember RuneMetrics? You genuinely have analytics which OSRS Runelite users get for free in the base client or via community made plugins which are locked behind a subscription paywall.

Bonds are fine. Cosmetics are fine, so long as you don't do what Nexon did with MapleStory and make everything in the cash shop 30 day rentals. But the ability to buy the chance to obtain 200,000,000 coins or enough XP lamps to supercharge your way to a 99 is way too much.",2025-06-25 21:57:12,1

So the fact I know those stories were continued and even finished in RS3 makes me want to play it again. The issue is that I just refuse to play it while the MTX is there.

Cosmetics would be one thing, but its not just cosmetics, its skill lamps, training dummies, etc. things that make the game pay to win.

I don't mind MTX things in games, hell I've bought enough random mounts and outfits from the Mogstation for FFXIV, and my League of Legends money spent stat is frankly embaressing to look at. I understand that MTX is there to help fund games, to keep servers running, and to pay staff to keep pushing updates. However, that MTX needs to be something I want to contribute too, rather than the predatory lootbox style the game currently has.

I also agree with the person who mentioned the idea of a true Fresh Start Server setup that is entirely restricted to its own clump of servers and isn't infected by the MTX already in the game.",2025-06-26 07:49:38,1

I genuinely thing that a drastic change like this gives RS3 a shot towards relevancy. The only period where RS3 content creation was popular, was with the fresh start worlds, take that as a hint.

I don't want raised XP on fresh start servers, just a fresh start. Let the old worlds exist as some sort of time capsule, because I genuinely think those worlds will just empty out like a cartoon clown car. An actual economy reset would make the early period of the worlds incredibly interesting and it'll probably attract A LOT of players. Visual progression is one of the strongest motivators an MMO can have, so the no-cosmetic worlds is already a good step, but please, try and actually rectify your mistakes by giving us worlds where we actually care about the progression.",2025-06-26 09:50:33,1

MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,n0iszda,tinverse,"Here are some serious problems RS3 has in my opinion if Jagex is actually paying attention to feedback.

* First and foremost is of course RTX. They have been so prevalent in the game for so long that I highly doubt you'll be able to pull them out of the game. The events have changes mid event to get more money. Cool items are basically just bought. Exp is essentially for sale.
* It's an MMORPG where you have glorified being maxed and being self sufficient. What is the point of that? There used to be skilling communities, minigame communities, PVP communities, slayer communities, massing and group bossing communities, etc. There were not many players focused on maxing, quest capes, etc. They just did the activities they enjoyed while chatting with friends. So much focus now is on being self sufficient or iron men and it's incentivized every time new items come out that are untradable or hidden behind quests which require you to be near maxed. This is such a dumb design pattern in a genre of game which has a core feature of playing WITH other people.
* This will probably be controversial, but as someone who quit playing around the time EOC happened. EOC is a disaster. Bossing in large groups was one of my favorite things to do in RuneScape. I don't even know how to fight a monster if I log in anymore and I'm basically maxed combat. Some people will say the OSRS combat style doesn't provide enough challenge. I never played RuneScape for the challenging combat. RS was like a big chatroom with an expansive game attached. I would just hang out and chat with people while doing things.
* Cosmetically, the game has an identity crisis. Back when I started playing, the game had kind of a dark theme. The sky was black because there wasn't a sky. Much of the art style was thin, almost gothic in nature. Or at least that's how it felt to me. Now it all reminds me of Imagenex toys for little kids. It's cartoony and happy. The proportions of the characters are just weird. So many of the MTX cosmetics don't make sense in runescape. I like the keepsake keys where you can combine items in the game to create a signature look. I don't like when someone is a giant half dragon man flying around with glowing rainbows shooting off in every direction and taking up half my screen or wearing a leather jacket and jeans or a bathing suite. It just doesn't fit the games theme. I am not saying everything needs to be a suit of armor, but I do think the items in the game should fit the visual themes of the game. This ties into the MTX point.
* Why are there so many skills which have turned into AFK siphoning? Runespan, divination, and archeology style siphoning is dumb. I think you have added that style of game loop to more things too. It just feels the same as all the other siphoning skills.

There are probably tons more, but I really don't expect Jagex to fix RS3.",2025-06-30 03:59:01,1

So my proposal is to NERF these items drastically and making them on PAR with actual training methods in the game. And the people that want to buy them can spend the $, I've always thought: play how you choose, everyone plays differently.

The way to fix the current state would be to introduce new items like ""dumb dummies"" and ""baby proteans"" which are the ones that scale to actual training method XP rates in game. Then the ones currently in players banks could still be used, and once they're gone, then they're gone. This could be supplemented by giving players a free additional 50 bank spaces for the news items.

You could even do a final last sale where people can purchase the old more powerful items directly, if there is enough demand. I do not think removing these things entirely will be at all helpful.",2025-06-25 16:38:56,1

I have a lot of proteans banked. Whilst none have been paid for it is a sucker punch that I and others who haven’t used them on DXP yet will be unable to use them, when others have and have had the exp from them.

Addressing the problems with MTX is good, but the core gameplay of the mid game in RuneScape 3 needs to change too, no new player is going to enjoy 500 hours of archeology or herblore just to complete a quest that gives rewards that are basically outdated by the time you receive them.",2025-06-26 01:18:50,1

MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,mztsc2s,A-Certain-Guy,"I think im gonna hop in on this and just give my 2 cents. 

Im an avid runescape player, I have played since 2006 and have extensive experience in both Rs3 AND OSRS. I am maxed  (99 all, dont care about 120 all until we have content in every single skill to back the need for that) on RS3 and working on both a main and ironman on OSRS currently.

Im going to be speaking based on my experience both as someone who plays both games and the opinions that i see from OSRS players regarding rs3 that are pertinent to this topic, some of which I share a similar opinion on.

  
First off, I want to see a severe drop (or, preferably, outright removal) in the amount of lamps/stars given from MTX, especially purchasable ones. If there is ever a common argument OSRS players have about RS3 is that you can (in theory), buy skills/progression. This is by far the biggest stance I agree with them on, as it devalues your progression as a player. Yes, The person next to you has 99 runecrafting, but how much of that was actually them training the skill vs slamming lamps/stars into it? I think the worse the skill is, the more lamps/stars are slammed into it. Keep in mind, I am specifically speaking about lamps from mtx/Treasure Hunter, not quest rewards like say, Sliske's Endgame lamp. You worked hard, that was your reward. MTX/TH is just ""You paid/existed, skip some training"". That is not okay to most players.

Second, I want to make sure jagex can still monetize the game, but in a less toxic format. That brings me to cosmetics that are locked behind TH/Battle Passes. If Jagex wants to keep monetizing these with TH/BP's, then they should become available in the future (let's say, a year for example) through Solomon's store (or maybe even through loyalty member points? \*wink wink\*). This would allow people to get normally inaccessible cosmetics a bit later than the ones who want to purchase it early, but not outright deny them from things like FOMO/bad timing etc.



TLDR: Don't let people buy progression, don't lock cosmetics permanently behind FOMO based paywalls with no way to get them otherwise.",2025-06-26 04:19:53,1

Very excited to see the results of these experiments. One thing I have been thinking about for a while is this: MTX is bad. The amount of free xp you get from daily spins alone is bad. However, I do really like that there is a mechanism that allows you to minimise the amount of time you need to spend grinding a skill you really don't enjoy, so you can focus more on content you actually enjoy. So what I would like to see is the removal of daily spins, while adding more ways to earn spins as you play the game. I honestly think it's fantastic that you get 2 spins when you complete a quest, because it (a) requires you to play through actual content,  (b) cannot be farmed and (c) still gives you some XP or at least bonus xp or Proteans to avoid having to grind. So why not add spins like this to other milestones? E.g. when you hit lvl 25, 50, 75, 99 in any skill you get a spin? Achievement diaries, get a spin, etc.",2025-06-26 17:15:04,1

That's a waste of a months testing.   
  
If you want more money, remove MTX completely. Add all of the TH items in game as rewards for playing. If you're woodcutting, every so often, you'll cut a protean log instead. Doing slayer earns you some slayer wildcard drops. So on and so forth. Next, use bonds to activate temporary modifiers to increase the chances of collecting proteins, wildcards, etc while you play. Imo, this is better than TH and won't shit out thousands of items in 30 clicks.   
  
Loads of people would be okay with a cosmetic shop, make them buyable with cash or for a bond and tradeable ingame so everyone has access to them. Instead of multiple pieces, make it a skin, a whole body override. That's the closest we're going to get to an avatar rework. I think the biggest issue with many cosmetics is that they're obnoxious, don't do that, lol.  
  
Also, you guys are losing massive amounts of profits, because you're not even trying to be competitive with gold farmers. Why would I spend $90 on premier, if I can go to a gold farmer, buy gold and buy bonds for $45? You need to permaban those who buy gold or remove the wealth bought PLUS 50%  in items or gold, PLUS rollback stats that can be bought.

Also, those DXP events they're talking about are a problem too. It makes players hoard/put off or plan specific things specifically for DXP, which is not a healthy gameplay loop (or economy) at all.  
There's other P2W in the game store they just ignored here, and dailies seriously need to be toned down in some way.  
There's also too many viable training methods where all you gotta do is click in one spot repeatedly to 99+ without ever leaving or changing anything.  
Holiday events are also absurd free AFK XP.

Lastly, there's still the problem of integrity being lost well over a decade ago.

i've done daily challenges and quests to get keys for lamps, skilling items, and XP to make the early and mid-game leveling process smoother. since i'm actually spending time in game doing content and having fun along the way, that means i'm committing to more membership time. new player retention could be stronger in this way, because you have to take the fun (and longer) way of getting keys, by doing content

all cosmetics and items earned through TH in this way should be untradeable. if players want to just get the cosmetics, then they can buy them directly as you describe in experiment 3, but also still being untradeable. this will prevent players from creating new accs and grinding early game content over and over for keys so that they can get and trade the items with other players

I understand RUNESCAPE is a business first, and that money needs to be made. I understand that a lot of the people whining about mtxs, are the same people who whine about every little thing and so I brush them off. The arguments against mtxs are weak at best laced with hoard mentality logic. Have they gone too far? Yes. I think the reliance on mtxs has certainly gone to the point that it seemed desperate. Hey, here's a ton of xp for cash. Now buying xp, I don't care and the argument against it is totally irrelevant. If someone buys their levels versus someone who grinds them, the person who bought them will be at a disadvantage, but no one got hurt. With that said, the new events just seemed too desperate and that I didn't like. It didn't feel like you didn't have to engage. It felt like if you didn't engage, you missed out. And that's not fair. But I'm also realistic. I'm willing to engage because I know that it supports a game that has been around since I was a kid. And I stand by that. I will gladly support a company that has provided me so much joy in my life. Again, I don't care about the arguments. They are all honestly weak at best, and more so opinion pieces. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But if someone buys keys, it doesn't affect the time it takes for another player to kill a boss. RUNESCAPE is grindy, and as an adult, I understand that people don't have the time to grind rs3 all day everyday. I've never seen weapons armor or anything that could ever be considered p2w. And I stand by that. I was a huge fan of cosmetic overrides being the main seeling point. And so I engaged with it. I love the over rides. I love being able to make a character mine, instead of everyone looking the same like on osrs. I don't want to look like everyone else. So I don't mind. But I do get that some people will never see it that way, and that mtx's are the bane of their existence and they just can't live knowing that treasure hunter exists. I find it silly, but it is what it is. Solution? Open worlds for the players that don't want to engage. Disable th on them, and disable everything cosmetic so everyone can look the same. Some players like that. Second: make everything in th grindable in game. Everything you can buy, you can earn for free through gameplay. I think that would solve a lot of the complaints. Not all, but most. I get that th provides money so we can get more content. So it's a part of the game that isn't pretty, but I do get it. Some people whining about mtxs just don't seem to get that. We can't just get everything for free. That's not how the world works. I would never expect the devs to bust their butts creating content for free. That's just not fair.

In a personal anecdote, I put up with playing alongside MTX ever since the inception of the squeal of fortune, I hated it - but I loved RS more. I continued to enjoy the game for 2-3 years, and then I realised the situation was getting worse and worse. I continued like this until \~2018 due to pure addiction, and tapered off until 2020 where I quit and never come back. A decision that has left me feeling vindicated, sadly.

**The company is owned by shareholders that only care about short-term profit**. These people are above Jagex, and **they do not give a** ***single shit*** **about you**. If they could vaporise your human body for a £50 note, they would.

The problem goes deeper, due to the prioritisation of MTX the game has seen rampant inflation (GP *and* XP) and the loss of expert staff - resulting in a lack of quality content.

MTX is a scourge on the gaming community, but especially for a game like RS - it is a cancer that is in a symbiotic realtionship with the shareholders. The root cause of this cancer is bigger than the existence of RS, lying in the hands of cutthroat capitalism.

**This is why I think nothing will change.**

*I'm glad I left this game 5 years ago, the only thing that could bring me back to try it, and only try it, would be the complete removal of treasure hunter and other forms of MTX.*",2025-06-25 18:12:37,-1

Even though these changes sound really good, I don't think this would be enough for me to come back to RS3.

Any achievements I've had in RS3 have been invalidated long ago by MTX and any future achievements... well, them as well. I could go for 200M xp in a skill and feel no satisfaction knowing there's hundreds if not thousands of people ahead of me on the hiscores that did not put in the time.

I would require fresh servers, with separate hiscores, where everyone starts at tutorial island once more. Even that though, might not be enough. I've previously dabbled with a HCIM in RS3 and realized that seasonal events were deterimental to the game mode. Things like AFK training Dungeoneering in a hole next to Lumbridge or AFK training Construction by building a battlement during the Bandos VS Armadyl event... yeah, that's not it.

I guess then this is what I would need to come back to RS3:

* New, separate servers with their own hiscores (and GE, etc)
* Everyone starts at tutorial island
* No rewards from seasonal events for any type of ironmen; significantly fewer rewards for non-ironmen
* No cosmetics (or the option to not see them)
* No purchase of (bonus) XP
* Direct purchase of GP would be fine, seeing RWT will always have lower rates anyway (as such, it wouldn't impact a thing)

But is this not just introducing more potential mtx into the game? This isn't the first time jagex has ""committed"" to reducing mtx. It isn't the second time, hell its probably the fifth or sixth time and each time mtx only increases. They say that they will experiment with reducing/turning off TH yet they're replacing it with buying xp DIRECTLY. Honestly I could argue that this is worse than treasure hunter and if it sticks will lead down a very slippery slope. August for the most part is a normal month just no proteans for dxp? So for a week or however long DXP is no proteans but regular TH? Why not turn off proteans for the month and see how the community/economy handles it? September introduces cosmetics that people have been asking for which is great, so good job there jagex. 

All that being said, maybe I'm just very distrustful of jagex after 10+ years of lies, but something still feels off about all of this. A very real, yet unfortunate outcome that I could see happening is after these test months conclude Jagex will keep TH turned on while they ""assess the feedback and data"" and slowly roll out all of these experiments into the live game. Ending us with TH + direct to buy xp + cosmetics + f2p cosmetics + metrics (Which hardly works) + bonds + whatever else mtx I'm forgetting. Jagex and mtx is just promises built upon lies, and honestly until something legitimately changes there's zero reason to believe that this time around is any different. Typical Jagex pattern will end this with everything staying the same but more mtx introduced in the long run.

I'm hopeful that these experiments will lead to some sort of good for the community in the long term, but I'm not holding my breath. And if jagex repeats their yearly pattern of promises and lies then I have no doubt that we'll simply end up with more mtx than we started with.",2025-06-25 17:06:46,0

A rework of the housing in RuneScape to give the player their own small realm that is completely top down customised via in game rewards and mtx would be great.

It would also be nice to see a move towards a prestige system as well at this point. The main game has long been oversaturated with maxed experience players, and needless to say the buzz of high scores just isn’t really important with the game being so long lived. No one’s going to remember who was rank 1 other than Zezima. I mean I certainly couldn’t tell you who’s rank 1 now nor should it matter. 

Being able to prestige could allow for more ridiculous experience mechanics and events without worrying about the minority of players who so desperately wish they could turn back time and hold ranks forever. Don’t get me wrong at one point myself included had these fantasies, but the desire for ranks has always hindered RuneScapes progress as a MMO sandbox. Constant updates that could have been fantastic are restrictive and unfun because a self proclaimed elite player base wants things to remain tedious to discourage others participation in their elite club.

Bring back the OSRS passion on Rs3. Many people prefer to play Ironman for that same reason - SHORTCUTS ARE KILLING THE GAME.

There's also creating proteans from divination  
  
The main idea being that the ideas behind mtx skilling items being able to sold at the GE for afk xp for those that can afford it while also rewarding those that make them, obviously these proteans and skilling dummies can never be better xp/h than traditional means but it could be interesting to see players creating an economy around items that used to be a point of contention.

The last thing to note, if this change were to be implemented all existing dummies and proteans would have to be removed for the impact to actually make a difference  

also as a whole bonus xp is a okay thing to keep in as a system but only if they way you obtain it is through standard gameplay and not p2w mechanics. 

maybe as an example a reward you can buy from minigames, it would allow people to experience old minigames while not being ""xp waste""  

Cosmetics from treasure hunter should absolutely go into the marketplace, but it should be ALL cosmetics, including ones brought out during the hero pass. I know for a fact that people want to get these cosmetics, but they either weren't interested in spending money on a CHANCE of the item, were turned away by the p2w nature of treasure hunter/hero's pass or simply weren't around when the item was available.

Remove the easy accessibility of experience, that TH offers, completely, and make what TH is, just, into some cosmetics instead of offering various skips in progression, sure it's nice to skip that one last 100k exp with some money, but the exp rates in the game are already so fast that it seems unnecessary, yes, i've bought a few times (like 3-4 in the past few years or so to test things) and came to the conclusion as many before me; this needs to stop and be gone from the game.

I honestly think, that, a battle pass that yall had once, just only cosmetics would still net you guys a decent amount of money and i know that TH is yalls primary income from players, since bonds (which... is also a problem imo) probably racks yall a couple of million a year (overexaggerate)

Remove any utilities that is in the game, that comes from TH, remove the experience you can get from TH, remove the money prizes you can get from TH (even though, the odds are low, i've gotten 50m not too long ago, though that ain't much, it still contributes something into the economy) 

I've seen what the designers in yalls department can do, animators, designers and such (probably the same, i don't work in that area, but u know) can make some HELLA DOPE outfits, nothing too flash, the summer outfit you can buy from G.E is honestly my favorite and it's like 1-2m? 

I've played this game, since I was a wee' lad, my first ever account ""PK RANGED PK"" or something extremely dumb back then got permanently banned due to botting (yes, i'll admit, i did that..) Never done it afterwards, i learned my lesson, off topic, but i'm still here and i'll always be apart of the community.

I want the best for Jagex, i want yall to succeed and go down in history and one of the best companies in the world, when it comes to gaming, and especially in the MMO genre that many of us, to this day, don't have that many options to pick from. Yall been a huge part of many of our lives, hell, Runescape has been my primary way of writing english with many other games such as wow, guild wars, league of legends (yes i know) fiesta online (if you know, u know) warframe (good game, highly recommended to try, no glaze) and i'm thankful for that, the amazing community RS3 and OSRS got, it feels so bad when the mods just sees us as a laughing stock and doesn't take peoples feedback to seriously and implements those feedback or at least, tries too. (in this case, it's RS3 i'm talking about, OSRS does a WAY better job, not fully perfected, but it's WAY better)

And for those who says ""cosmetics shouldn't be apart of RS3"" there are options for that, perhaps, something that could hide everyones mtx with a turn on turn off fuction? like the ""mtx free world"" yall are implementing.

I hope, for the love of god, yall don't mess with us again, because, the communities skin is wearing thin and a lot of us, including me, wishes that this game, would be MTX free, especially in the TH department, with the stunts yall have tried to pull in the past year or so, is really... really not that fun.

The 3 biggest reasons I quit were:

1. Bots - bots just made the game feel so, I don't know, fake? They were all over the place, sometimes even interfering with my own gameplay in the case of competitive resources. And they wreaked havoc on the game's economy, resulting in strangely unbalanced prices for many items. The economy wasn't just ruined by bots though, but also by strange balancing choices with some monster drops and by the absolutely massive inflation. Seriously, do they have any data on how much GP the average player had back in the day versus now? The inflation must be insane

2. MTX - pretty self explanatory. Every time I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. Like all the higher ups had their heads in the sand permanently chasing short-term profits above all else. Completely devalued the sense of personal achievement and ruined the in-game economy in many ways.

3. Visual diarrhea - way way waaaaay back in the game, RuneScape actually had a pretty focused and cohesive medieval fantasy artistic vision. Armors and weapons looked believable. They weren't overly flashy and tacky, they were functional and immersive. But over time they just kept making everything look more and more absurd, especially with cosmetic overrides and big, flashy, obnoxious animations. Even simple things like particle effects, they just went way overboard with them. Or things like that stupid mopey dopey depressed standing animation.

I have no idea if any of these complaints have been addressed in any meaningful capacity since the last time I played (at least 7 years ago) but it'd be nice if #2 and #3 could actually be rectified. I'd also like to see new servers that serve as a completely fresh start, NONE of your account progress carries over. Not your levels, not your items, not your unlocked cosmetics, nothing. (And would have its own GE) Because even if problems are fixed, in many cases the damage has already been done (such as a tainted in-game economy from things like MTX)",2025-06-26 03:41:04,-1

I have run less than 50 agility laps in RS3, yet over the course of 14 days I 99'd my agility. One Christmas event, I used my oddments, rolled my keys, turned everything but lamps into oddments, bought keys, opened presents, repeat.

Over and over and over, I didn't leave the Grand Exchange or spend a penny, and I 99'd a skill I hate.

I should've been happy, but I looked at it and just thought, what the fuck am I doing. Agility isn't a great skill, but I shouldn't go from less than 90 agility to 99 in the space of two weeks without training it once. Nothing will ever change that, nothing will make me want to grind any skill in this game again, and it's a shame because I fucking love Runescape.

I mean damn, you're disabling Treasure Hunter but allowing people to still buy knowledge bombs and stars, you're not doing this for the good of the game, you're doing this so people have to pay money for the exp instead.

Even if it's something as ham-fisted as just making legacy way stronger so that it's a legitimately equal alternative, EoC must be addressed, and I question whether any solution that fails to do so will actually achieve the goal of making RS3 not just survive, but *flourish*. You've explicitly acknowledged the need for a clear visual game identity, and addressing EoC is the very obvious next step in that line of thinking: just as it's good for the game to have a clear visual identity, it's also good for the game to have a clear combat identity. And until EoC, it did. Runescape's combat system has always been one of its most unique and defining features, and abandoning it so drastically in RS3 caused the game to be unrecognizable for a big chunk of us. There were a lot of things about RS3 I really loved and would love to be able to return to (did you hear about the mining and smithing rework?) - that's why I kept playing it long enough to get a comp cape - but I just don't see myself ever coming back from OSRS until/unless EoC is addressed, and I know I'm not the only one who feels that way.",2025-06-26 00:13:55,-1

Turning off TH as one of these experiments worries me a bit, as it kind of sounds like if these changes come to pass the only way to earn XP items would be seasonal events, monthly members benefits, and to buy them from the store.

I disagree, however, that this is something that players should “wait and watch” on. An experiment like this is important, and the most feedback they can get is from players like us who have lost trust in them.

With that being said, I intend to at least buy one month worth of membership to give the game a try during these experiments. I would like to get a feel for what vision they see, and I’ll give my honest feedback with hopes that those visions are worthwhile. I love RS3, despite not having played it in years. These experiments don’t look like a scummy way to get players back, it looks like a desperate cry for help because, and let’s face it, the game is dying VERY fast and is well on its way to being done forever.

I also encourage many old school runescape players, even the ones who have never played RS3, to play. RS3 has taken the big hits of MTX to prove that OSRS has the capability of being a successful game without it. Now I believe it’s time that the entire community comes together and gives RS3 a chance if they are truly experimenting with removing MTX as a whole.

If it works out, it’s possible Jagex can even experiment with a total RS3 server wipe, possibly opening up a whole new realm of ideas (refreshing dead content, removing dead content, and emphasizing group gameplay [ya know, the core of an MMO])

If OSRS can succeed without MTX, then RS3 should also be able to, especially with the state of the game it is in (aside from the crazy amount of dead content)",2025-06-25 16:40:16,36

For new players the UI absolutely needs an overhaul. There should be a sufficient default option and a tutorial going over the UI. Simplify it and make it better. 

Directly buying xp and raw materials (proteans, dummies, etc) should not be a thing. Buying bonus xp should be the alternative with limits per day. You should still have to buy raw materials to train your skills vs using proteans, even with an accelerated rate. Cosmetics are a good thing to have as microtransactions, but they should be a direct purchase, not by chance.

I have 16 years of playing the game. I've quit three times and MTX was a part of each time. I would love a 'RS4' that is free of these issues. I have a 200m main and I would be okay with a fresh start if its free of RWT and MTX. As much as the community hated it, I actually think the trade restrictions was the right call. 

I really would love a fresh start RuneScape where everyone's progress is unaffected by their real life wealth. This was a core tenet to RS under the Gowers that always resonated with the player base. If Jagex is wanting the main MMO to have a successful future, spend a year reworking the world map and UI to be cohesive and modern and launch a parallel version to RS3 that is MTX free. Keep the current RS3 servers up and just update both in parallel.

Truth is, player progress has no legitimacy left. I was maxed before MTX came out and those 99s felt more rewarding than getting 200m all did. I think my 99 prayer in 2005 was a bigger accomplishment than 200m all because of how much MTX impacted everything.",2025-06-26 12:47:32,2

2. Nuke RS3 or give us fresh start servers that lock out anyone who purchased ANY form of MTX. I will play if I never have to set foot in the same server as the kind of person who buys fast tracking progress in a video game.

If there's even one form of MTX aside from a membership bond, I will not play the game and will continue to dissuade others and shit talk RS3 to every person who will listen, doing my best to make sure the game dies for what you did to twelve years old me all those years ago when you added the squeal of fortune.",2025-06-25 22:30:34,-1

That is why they're also exploring the avatar rework again, because they realise a better character model rig will allow them to increase revenue whilst at the same time sunsetting pain points in their MTX strategy. 

So what will probably happen is that the cosmetic-free worlds experiment will give them data that shows players prefer a more grounded look when looking at their and other players' avatars. Then they will change the design philosophy for new cosmetics to make them look more grounded and that's that. 

This may be an unpopular opinion but I highly doubt they will keep cosmetic-free worlds around or add the option to hide other people's cosmetics when focussing on more cosmetic MTX is the only card they have.

I've noticed a massive cultural shift away from subscriptions. People lament having to pay monthly fees for everything. Services that offer something of value just about get away with it (Gamepass for example is very valuable to play games you'll only play once for dirt cheap). But I've seen a lot of recent comments against MMO subscription models for new and upcoming games. I think the rise of ""Free-to-play"" or ""Buy-to-play"" has conditioned new generations to actively prefer this.

RuneScape is such an old, messy, niche and not very pretty game that charging a higher subscription fee than not only better value services like Gamepass but other MMOs like World of Warcraft would destroy the game financially.

Notice how Jagex talk about ""new ways to monitise the game"". They know this too. I suspect they'll shift to ad-based revenue (the mobile game method of watching regular ads to play a free game), or a Buy-to-play expansion model, with an optional subscription fee that gives everything plus a few bonuses.",2025-06-25 19:36:19,1

Like the legacy only worlds where you cannot use EoC combat. If a player is bothered by cosmetics they can use these specific worlds.



It would be very tricky to directly remove all cosmetics. Some players have spent a lot of money on them and would rightly feel ripped off if their purchases were just removed.

As it is I think how they deal with existing XP boosting items is potentially going to be tricky. XP lamps and stars can't be banked so most are likely to have already been used but proteans and skilling station can be banked, I think they either need to prevent gaining more of these items but allow use of existing ones or remove them all and provide some type of compensation per item to players with them. Allowing the use of existing items is probably the less complicated way to go.



Keeping cosmetics as purchasable items in the marketplace is completely fine by me, as long as there are no XP gaining or any other in game bosting items available for real money purchase. Jagex will lose money by removing TH keys but keeping purchasable cosmetics will help reduce the blow.",2025-07-08 02:50:31,1

It's been quite a while since I've played RuneScape largely due to MTX. I understand MTX has a good revenue to level of effort ratio, but there are endless games, especially mobile, where the long term effects on player base are well understood.

Like most gamers who are interested in RuneScape style games, the first key driver is exploring new content. RuneScape did a fantastic job giving the feeling that there is always something new around the corner. That feeling of exploration connects with the audience and is able to hook in players. The quests have a variety so it doesn't feel like a loop of repetitive content. 20 years ago I used to maintain a spreadsheet of what goals I had hoped to achieve by the end of the month, I get that gaming may not be productive, but to a gamer this also meant purpose. It is not quick to meet some of these goals so RuneScape also instilled accomplishment.

Then we have to consider the LTV of each player. Once their hooked, we should expect that the feel good exploration feeling will no longer be there, can keep players engaged through new content, and it's more geared towards purpose and accomplishment.

MTX has completely killed both purpose and accomplishment.  When you create a path that money can achieve game goals quicker or easier, a player will decide if they want to go through that path. The feeling of accomplishment is directly correlated with the effort that it took to get there, those who get there quickly and easily, that feeling of accomplishment is short lived and with the lack of feeling of true accomplishment it does not leave the players yearning as much more than if it felt like a true accomplishment.

And then you have players who do not want to participate in MTX. I got 99 fletching before Make-X. Yes, I gave myself carpal tunnel over the course of many months to achieve that. It was a good feeling bonding between another player who went through the same process, you knew there were also players didn't want to go through that process, there was no sense of accomplishment greater than that moment and that what had driven my purpose. Of course Make-X came out later and all of that feeling was short lived - MTX is like this on steroids. Any path that's easier and separates the player base, like spending money, is going to devalue that and how much it's devalued is directly proportional to how much easier MTX gets there.

I can't remember the last time I played RuneScape. All I remember is it was during an MTX promo event where I dropped a very large amount of cash and completely  cheesed a skill like 120 farming. Almost 23 years of continuous membership and my last memory of RuneScape was how dumb and easy it was to spend money to devalue the decades of work I spent slowly and strategically building up my character.

And for 100% honesty, I'm never coming back to RuneScape unless every character progress is reset to ground 0 and this time MTX is only cosmetic. The only other compromise that can be made is if a parallel world is created, like the abyss worlds of Melvor Idle, and we can start fresh without MTX but still retain all previous character progress. Y'all chose short term profit over sustainability, ignored all the feedback from us players on how it was impacting us, and I'm sorry to say there is very little that can be done to fix that. 

At this point the company should expect quick player turn overs, squeeze whatever left you can on the last surviving loyal players, and remember the good times before MTX was a thing",2025-06-25 18:31:22,14

Every piece of FOMO engagement metrics/dailyscape has turned the game into a job rather than a list of achievements.

But the playerbase wants keys and free xp.  And they've cultivated this playerbase for over a decade now.

I think the news is very, very positive, because straight out of the gate, we have a month with no treasure hunter.  And after that, an entire bxp weekend without proteans.

That's more commitment to reform for MTX than we've \*ever\* seen.  Bravo to the new manager (and I say that as someone who supported his recently-criticised push to take politics out of the game -- if he keeps this up, I'm excited).

But I strongly suspect that the remaining players only play for the fomo and dailyscape treadmill instead of earning anything.  And those players are going to react just like you -- pointing out that the handouts are gone, and so are they.

And ultimately, my gut feeling is that the game is just too far gone at this point to recover.  If this happened before necro released and made every pvm veteran quit, it might have stood a chance, but there's simply nothing compelling to keep people around anymore with the death by a thousand cuts of everything catering to a mobile lowest common denominator playerbase.",2025-06-25 16:28:09,12

Even though I haven't been around for the last 15 years and a lot has changed, I can see the damage MTX has done to the game. To see the community shrinking disheartens me because I remember ""how things used to be"" and I'm not looking through rose-colored glasses. When I quit 15 years ago, I was considered late mid-game/early end-game and, at combat level 125, saw many players at various stages of the game.


When I play now, everyone seems to be already at end-game and I don't think that's all that healthy for a game as that's indicative that there's a lack of fresh blood. And I'm sure that can be attributed to many reasons, one of which seems to be that MMO's are on the decline on the whole.


It appears the community has been calling for Jagex to take action for some time now, so I hope that this is the step in the right direction so that we can see Runescape for another 10, 15, 20 years.


Needless to say, because of my desire to look cool as hell, I definitely would spend money for cosmetics and I'm looking forward to the Cosmetic Mega Drop and hope to see stuff from the Hero Pass (like the Undead Slayer outfit, please!) and the quiver from the Archery Looting Range TH.",2025-06-25 18:09:15,2

1. RuneLite (Lite), or some variance of it. Missing QuestHelper, Tile Markers, and Timers make it nearly unplayable especially with 500+ quests. I don't much enjoy alt tabbing to the Wiki every 2s trying to read or watch a youtube video. You could argue you're supposed to ""play the quests naturally, and figure it out"".. but let's be honest, nobody is doing that. Maybe 1-5% of players actually play in that way. 

2. Interface cleanup, I love ""legacy"" mode, and even ""legacy combat"" mode waaay more than EOC and having 15 action bars. Between there being so many items in the game, and the interface and bank interface being so cluttered, it's hard to go from super clean looking OSRS + Runelite to RS3. 

3. I know it would probably NEVER happen, but EOC sucks (IMO), but if it was a simplified version of it, like Guild Wars 2 for example, where instead of giving the player a ""World of Warcraft"" amount of buttons, 20+. Give the player like 10, maybe an action bar's worth of buttons to use. That simplifies combat while keeping EOC alive. I think that would be so sick. You'd still want to maybe swap out buttons for certain bosses or activities but it simplifies the game a bit.",2025-06-25 16:12:53,1

You don't have to do it all at once, it can be done in a similar manner to graphical updates.

What you want to do is find developmental space far from the current world map and make a new, isolated instance of Lumbridge and the surrounding farmlands. The actual space that Lumbridge once occupied would be made inaccessible by walking, but transition points at the borders would go to the new zone.

 This would let you make a new, bigger map over time without needing to jettison currently exists doing it all at once. It would still be a lot of work to move all the nodes and such for Quests and other content in the area, but it would make the task more manageable. With the next update, the chunk of the current map covering Draynor and the Wizard's tower would be transferred to the new map, with new transition points to the original map.

This would new areas to be added to the mainland, for example the inaccessible duchy of Lumford.

Combination of shrinking playerbase with ever increasing scrutiny from the EU government on predatory MTX(gambling) in video games would be my guess. Which makes sense going from keys to directly buying the items, they'll completely sidestep the gambling part. MTX is a massive part of their income, they aren't going to completely throw it away for no reason. Everything they do is in an effort to increase the bottom line, that's just how businesses work. They stand to gain an entirely new MTX market by going this route too. A lot more people would most likely be willing to straight up buy exp than gamble with keys. 

My tinfoil hat theory is this is just a play to get a lot of returning players back for the ""experiments"", hope they stick around, and then just keep chugging along with MTX as usual.",2025-06-29 12:45:57,1

Some ideas for example:

\- Keys obtained for finishing quests and for completeing dailies could give oddments instead. Obviously, easier quests shouldn't give too much, grandmaster ones could give a healthy amount like 500 or 1000, and the current Daily Challenge rewards would need to be refreshed a bit. Obviously, the oddments shop would need to be expanded too, it's currently... very lacking. This would also replace the oddments obtained from daily Treasure Hunter keys.

\- Protean packs need to go and while existing packs shouldn't be removed, new packs shouldn't enter the game either. Protean items on the other hand can easily stay I think. Perhaps make it possible to transmute a set amount of regular items to make protean ones using divination? For example, 20 raw crayfish and 30 pale energy could make 2 protean protein, 20 raw rocktail and 30 incandescent energy could make 15 protean protein etc). That way unwanted low-level resources could be converted to more useful ones at a cost, or high-level ones for the convenience of proteans I guess. Balancing this would be kinda difficult though, probably. No, I'm sure it would be.

\- Converting skilling and combat dummies to skilling and combat accelerators. Using one could give a set xp boost for a certain amount of time or actions similar to pulse cores and brawling gloves, but would only work specifically in their respective skills and couldn't be used at the same time as pulse cores for example. I think making them with Invention could definitely do the trick.

\- Portable skilling stations... are actually fine to be honest. There's one slightly change I'd make to them though. I'd keep the current effects they have, but reduce the base xp by a small amount as a cost for using them and benefiting from their effects, which could be offset by xp boosting items anyway. That way, regular skilling spots could become more relevant again.

\- Lamps need to go. They're simply bad. They should not exist. Stars on the other hand are good in my opinion. With the example changes made above, players would actually need to interact with actual game content anyway. Having \*toggleable\* bonus xp would continue to make it possible to speed up content which people don't like, and at the same time not hurting the game nearly as much as it currently does when combined with most MTX items.

Obviously DXP tokens would need fixing too. They could probably be given based on your DXP gains? For example, 1 token for every 1K xp I guess.",2025-06-25 18:56:14,2
MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,mzqa7fv,CNCStarter,"My personal two cents as someone who only started playing rs3 in the last 4 years and has been on and off...

Afkscape is actually pretty satisfying. Playing a little bit of runescape passively on my phone is a huge benefit for being able to get a quick fix of gaming when I'm working or something. If I'm addicted, I wanna log in randomly, but if I'm busy then being able to afk is nice.

Improving the mobile client a bit to better handle more pvm abilities would be very nice to let me boss on it too.

Pvm is insanely fun, but hard to get into initially. Death cost changes were amazing, but the dry streaks on boss kills are soul crushing and make me want to quit. Grico being basically mandatory for ranged but being off raksha who drops basically nothing means I'm potentially farming at a loss for a few months and then immediately consuming every item I get. Bad luck mitigation or being able to see guaranteed progress towards a thing I need makes me a lot more likely to stick out the grind even if its 800 kills.

Most skills are awful to grind and I dont have the interest or patience to do so legitimately, TH lamps is the easiest way around it, if I wanted to play grindy content I cant afk I'd play OSRS. Fishing in specific is the worst thing I've ever seen. RS3 shouldn't be a competitor to OSRS offering the same gameplay loops, as you'll lose to nostalgia every time for that segment of the community. Making RS3 be more of a high level experience or an afkable experience is a good niche to stand out on.

The good gameplay of rs3 starts at high level and adding more reasonable ways to grind some of these older skills would be a fantastic improvement to attract new players, or adding lower level bosses / milestones, because those are what string players along. I got strung along wanting to get all the teleport locations unlocked which forced me through the entire elven quest line, getting gated by skills, and then I wanted to pursue all prayers and spells..  etc.

Necromancy as an easy pvm entry skill is a noob trap that makes the game less enjoyable long term imo, it caps out too early and easily, and has too low of a skill ceiling. Wanting to continually improve my dpm for better rewards and more bosses being doable has been a constant motivator for me, and it led me to learn full manual and that significantly deepened the game for me as I got into micro optimizing. Necromancy doesnt benefit from full manual to the same degree at all, robbing players of that motivation and making the difficulty to reward ratio too non favorable for the average player to care about. Making necromancy act as a gateway into the other styles ​and making some bosses resistant or immune to necro would be a good long term ladder for players to climb.

Adding fun alternative ways to get exp like skilling bosses that drop good high end stuff rarely is a better way to engage players in the 70s-80s than forcing them to cut trees, but the rate of exp needs to be solid. I think skilling boss design is brilliant and we need more of it for all tiers.

  
Time gated stuff like player owned ports making me wait nearly 6 months to get into basic mage tank armor was something I started logging into only for that, doing nothing else, until I eventually quit. I thought that was my only route to pvm so I was just waiting. Time gated stuff is bad. Constantly dangling an achievable carrot in front of players is a huge design win.",2025-06-25 17:10:06,3

I went from my (almost maxed) main on rs3 to an ironman on osrs because I desperately wanted to experience the grind of early-mid game and *feel* that my progression mattered, every time I get a new drop it's feels phenomenal, like I'm SO excited - I did this purely because I felt a real sadness on my main on rs3 that I'd kind of blown through the early mid game experience because of bloated XP (I've never once purchased MTX and I've still wracked up 10s and 10s of millions of bonus XP, and basically lamped the entire way to 100+ farming)

It comes tinged with a tiny bit of sadness because I know on RS3, if I started a new ironman, there'd be *even more* earlygame content to go through and experience, but additions like necro have warped the early-mid game really hard and make it less appealing to hop in to than osrs. 

All that to bring it to a point of relevancy - I would be back to RS3 (as a non iron) in less than a heartbeat for good if the early-mid game was made more rewarding and smoothed to get us to engage with it, leading nicely into later game and early PVM without the pressure of any MTX or even the extremely bloated dailies that feel obligatory to make halfway decent progress. The game has so much amazing content and the XP rates and afk'ability of much of it make getting 120s not horrendous - I think the grind of some select 120s like arch as an iron would feel quite tedious (which is partly also what puts me off), and so a true economy that isn't bloated with MTX inflation would make the game feel so amazing even as a non-iron.

Sorry for the spiel and its decoherence, I just think at its core rs3 has the potential to be the pinnacle of what an mmo should be with its mind-boggling amount of content and genuinely really fun PVM, it just needs to have the rot removed from it.",2025-06-25 18:33:20,4

That said, I do have a piece of constructive feedback regarding their implementation.

Please consider the decision not to disable keepsaked items on these worlds.

Keepsaked items are not purely cosmetic MTX rewards; they are actual in-game physical items that players have earned or acquired through legitimate gameplay. The keepsake system was originally intended to allow players to preserve the look and feel of their gear without sacrificing function or stats. Although I do understand doing so may seem like it may miss the mark or dilute what those worlds are truly trying to accomplish.

I completely understand and support the idea of removing flashy, immersion-breaking elements—things like oversized wings, glowing auras, particle effects, or loud cosmetics from MTX promotions. Those are the real culprits when it comes to visual clutter and immersion loss. But most keepsaked items aren’t those things. They’re often subtle, lore-rich, legacy armors or pieces with personal value and relevance to the player experience—especially for skillers, who value visual expression during low-intensity gameplay.

From a skiller’s perspective, I don't believe wearing a keepsaked Grace of the Elves, or a trimmed skillcape, undermines the intent of cosmetic-free worlds. If anything, it enhances the vibe and aligns with the aesthetic RuneScape was originally built on and what these worlds would be designed to do. If the concern is more PvM-focused—such as in group bossing environments where identifying gear matters—then perhaps further restrictions could be targeted to combat situations or PvM-specific locations. IE: wilderness like disablement. But if the goal of these new worlds is to give players a cleaner, more immersive visual space overall, then excluding all keepsaked gear could feel unnecessarily heavy-handed.

I'm open to being corrected if I’m misunderstanding the technical or philosophical reasoning behind the restriction. But I do believe there’s a meaningful distinction between MTX cosmetics and legacy gear that has simply been keepsaked for convenience. That nuance matters, and I hope it’s taken into account.

Happy to continue the discussion—just wanted to put this perspective out there in good faith.",2025-06-26 12:23:09,2
MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,mztj8zr,SleepingFishOCE,"This is the problem with the average player mindset in RS3, you consider having base 99's as being in the midgame, not the journey to get to that point.

A new player is not going to think like this, neither is a returning player.

Once a skill hits around 70 your out of the early game and into the midgame, this is where things start to become a real grind, especially skills like herblore and Archeology,

I came back to the game, created an ironman to actually experience the game without all the bullshit boosted MTX stuff and holy hell, i have spent more time in the midgame than my maxed main account took getting maxed.

That is the difference here, The midgame is slow and grindy, asking things like 80 herblore from people who are playing the game properly (not p2win) is a massive step up from the quests that come prior to it.

Look at fort:   
Every quest leading upto Requiem for a Dragon is pretty mild, requires a little investment into skills (which are leveled alongside the quests via fort building anyway), then all of a sudden its ""Oh you need 86 archeology now, have fun with that 500 hour grind"".    
  
No GotE btw  
No brooch btw  
No invention auto-screener btw

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of what it is now either (yes I'm aware of revolution etc.), but it really doesn't matter how much they polish up the system, I'm never going to like it because it simply isn't Runescape combat.

But to answer your question, the last time I played was 2020 or 2021 - well into EoC with much of the polishing already done.

> The current EoC isn’t even that far removed it basically just feels like RS but with more control in your DPS, protection, and movement if you want that. 

I strongly disagree. Ability-based combat is a very different animal that requires way more effort in a way I don't find enjoyable at all, and which isn't what I signed up for. Just as a matter of principle, it's dirty to just change a fundamental component of a game out from under people with huge investment in that game. I didn't sign up for EoC, I signed up for Runescape, so suddenly changing it into something different is a big shitty rug pull that I've never truly forgiven them for.

> If you don’t you can pretty much just set it up point and click and focus on the occasional movement or prayer like OSRS if you want?

Are you telling me I can do endgame PvM on legacy? All the encounters with mechanics that basically require shield abilities are playable on legacy? Because if that's what you're telling me, then that's big news to me and would absolutely make me reconsider all this. But as far as I'm aware, legacy is still a meme and not something you can actually play the entire breadth of combat content with viably, so it may as well not exist. You can't seriously expect us to accept ""well you can just be a permanent second class citizen with impotent DPS and limited access to end game content"" as a solution lol, zero reason to accept that when we could just keep playing OSRS instead. That's why I'm saying that if they won't remove EoC, they need to at least put legacy at parity with it so that what you're saying will actually become true and we really will be able to just opt-out.

> the idea it needs to be tossed aside is kind of crazy.

No crazier than saying MTX needs to be tossed aside. Both are shitty changes that fundamentally altered the nature of the game away from what the community signed up for and expected it to be, and both drove away a ton of players as a result. Ask OSRS players why they left RS3 and the strong majority will say either EoC or MTX, or both.

> So much of the game’s identity is built on it at this point

This is sunk cost fallacy. ""We're already super invested in this mistake so let's just keep digging deeper."" I do recognize that this does likely mean that Jagex will in reality not be willing to undo it because it'd be a *gargantuan* effort, which is why I presented the suggestion of legacy parity as the next best thing. But in any case, ""they're unlikely to want to undo all their investment into EoC"" is not an argument for whether it's actually good to keep EoC, it's just an observation about human nature.",2025-06-26 03:29:56,2

That's where OSRS has been doing a better on, they've been building content with existing gameplay loops in mind for awhile.

[So far it's been](https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/player-support-is-changing---2025-roadmap):

Chat spam filters  
Reporting outcome notifications  
and a single point of contact.

Since it's taken months for the above I have to assume we are just skipping on all of the industry standard solutions for ticket management and making jagex's own flavor. Report outcomes are great but kinda crazy it's taken this long in the first place.

A single point of contact hasn't really seemed to benefit people yet but still fresh so data might not be great. CS doesn't seem better nor has my experience improved but anecdotal.

In game chat is still basically dead and not noticed a change. Idk what the spam filters change actually did or how much it helped in the grand scheme of things but only 5.5k mutes as a result seems incredibly small. Pretty sure I could get the same numbers spending the day at the GE.

This is also crazy as runelite already has a far better system in place that users can customize too. Should suggest to higher ups to just hire the people who worked on that spam filter. Without it even to this day public chat is basically dead.

The future has in store for us:  
Account hijack detection  
Live chat  
Improved ban appeals  
Secure account recovery  
and RWT / cheater targeting.

Most of these are super basic things that shouldn't take a year either nor should the game have gone 2 decades without such basic things. The only one that's not basic is going after RWT and cheaters and that's been a battle Jagex has fought over 20 years as well and there's still just blatant and rampant botting and gold selling.

The chase for never-ending growth and profit is absolutely cancerous to society. You used to pay around £5 a month to get access to all RuneScape members content. That fee paid for server upkeep and new content. The servers worked near perfectly, the content was high quality updates almost every week of varying size and that was enough. That's how Jagex functioned. We paid their bills. They made us content to play. There was no nickel and diming, no MTX, no abusive psychological monetization practices. **For 11 years.**

People are actually missing that Jagex's ""experiments"" are not turning off MTX. They are turning off the gambling factor and capping the purchases. 

> We will turn off Treasure Hunter, **instead offering bundles of Stars and Knowledge Bombs for direct purchase (capped at 1 bundle per day)**

and

> We will offer a large selection of past cosmetic overrides - including some previously only available via TH - for direct purchase all at once

The gambling part of MTX is obscenely toxic, but this doesn't address the problem itself. Making players pay an expensive £8.99 monthly cost while offering additional purchases. They are trying out conditioning players into making a ""daily"" purchase because it's capped. That is still abusive monetization as it prays on FOMO.

Jagex is a lost cause. If only an indie company, not beholden to greedy shareholders, would come around and snatch the rug from under them because there is such a gap in the MMO market for a RuneScape-like game.",2025-06-25 20:11:58,1

I just don't want to pay money to a private equity fund that seems happy to run the game into the ground for short term gain. I'm an accountant and I've seen a LOT of private equity fund financial statements. I'm not a fan of private equity when it behaves like a leech. The Carlyle Group was behaving like a leech. These experiments *suggest* that CVC recognise that squeezing the life out of the game is not prudent. If that leads to a better game, great. I'll come back. If they continue to be focused on squeezing money out of whales until eventually the game dies off, then I'm no longer interested. Private equity only listens to money.

If they want long-term sustainable income, MTX are not the way for the game, which is what the surveys have told them.

Osrs is a pvm end game just as well and majority of gear is buy able. And then there are exceptions like smithing, crafting, con where multi hundred hour grinds for 200m xp is turned into something you can do in a day (demonic thrones and assembling crystal Armour). Pvp also exists though the pvp community mostly likes/tolerates rwt for the most part since it's more people for them to kill for good gear whether that's an active pvper risking more or preventing a pvpers from taking a break to grind more gp and thus 1 less pvpers to fight.

And lots of skills are 0 time anyway. 

The hard limit exists for many skills but it's not a big part of the game. Bonds definitely do let you unlock the vast majority of the game or progress the quickest. It's fine to point it out though that it's only 90% as bad as can be instead of 100% or 99% bad.",2025-06-25 18:02:12,-1

Like golden bamboo for woodcutting is the only 15 min afk option and it’s effectively a daily… unlocked at 96, or thieving which needs the 99 cape to unlock these methods (oblivious changes this a bit). 

Nothing for divination, herblore, summoning, hunter, fletching, runecrafting, crafting, etc. 

And the methods for skills that do exists are usually stupid unreachable for progression, like cooking has a 15 min afk via bait and switch, the pre req being 99 archaeology. 

Idk, mtx accurately identified an issue and solved it, I think the only way to remove mtx and still solve that issue is either powercreep xp methods to null the issue, or proper afk methods at slow xp to let players slowly progress to a goal when they dislike the active skill methods.

The only thing is that bonds **can't** have a ""strict and definitive price"" - you *need* the free market to dictate its price or it can't work. Jagex would have to actively create bonds to sell for gp to make that happen, which is essentially giving away free membership since I don't think the shareholders would value a partyhat on their quarterly report. You need them to only exist as players buying membership in exchange for gp, which can only happen if the price is dynamic to accommodate changes in the value of gp and irl money.

You get your daily keys and keys from quests or other in game stuff and that's it.  But keys still give lamps and stars and silverhawk feathers and proteans.  Maybe the TH cosmetics have a ""buy for money"" option but XP shouldn't be buyable as far as I'm concerned.  

But having lamps and stars and proteans and dailies and dxp as a way to ""bypass the grind"" I think you will find a LOT of current RS3 players will squeal like stuck pigs if you try to take that away.  See for example the hubub with hero pass which I think was such a big thing mainly because they took away the most OP daily in the game (daily challenges) at the same time and advertised the ""much less OP and more p2w"" heropass as a replacement for it.

A very large chunk of total xp comes into the game from daily challenges, plus all the extra rewards from it, for doing very little. Not to mention it being a repeatable thing rather than a one-off reward, like from quests, is a big contributing factor.

And when you say ""skills they'd not otherwise train up"", that's part of the issue as well - skipping skills and not training them *shouldn't* be a thing; the game should be *played* and you should be rewarded for the effort put in, not for just logging in and claiming a reward. This is one of the contributing factors to our active player count being so low - many just log in, claim stuff like their TH, dailies, JoT, invention machines, etc., and log out, so hardly anyone's actually *playing*.

If we want improved player numbers, there has to be an incentive to actually play the game, rather than be rewarded for simply logging in and not playing. There's an inbalance in the amount of effort vs amount of reward that currently incentivises playing less often. This also ties into things like dxp being run too often, pushing players to just wait for each dxp to play; more incentive to not play.

Personally, I think if they want to keep daily challenges, they should have to be unlocked as part of each skill, rather than something available by default on brand new accounts, and massively toned down in the amount of xp given (especially if they keep the extra rewards). I don't know what form it would take, but I think something like slayer or arc contracts would be a good starting design point.

But, I don't expect we'll ever agree on anything like that, which is why I was primarily talking about there being a conflict among the players over stuff like this. I'm on one end and you're probably on the other - Jagex making a change to reduce dailyscape might make me happy but annoy you. They're going to have to wrestle with that conflict, and I assume no matter what changes they do make, a lot of players will still be unhappy.",2025-06-26 10:34:42,3

I 100% prefer games to limit MTX and all that bullshit, its why developers like From Soft are the best IMO.   I am a relatively new Runescape Player, but I just don't really see how the outcry about MTX from communities like reddit match the seriousiousness of the problem.  I do not feel like I am being goaded into spending money every time I login, it seems like a small aspect of the game and can be ignored easily.  This game has pretty limited PvP so I don't really see the harm in people spending money to progress their own account...it does almost nothing to affect other players as far as I can tell?  

How are they bleeding the game dry?  They seem to be continually adding new content in the couple months that I have played, and the game has more content than 99.9% of games...I find it unreasonable to assume they are dedicating huge amount of resources to devise new ways to get people to buy MTX.  It is sadly just a part of the gaming landscape now, especially as costs have ballooned and developers don't seem to know how to spend appropriately.  

I say let whales be whales.  They compromise a very small percentage of a games player base.  I am not so cynical that the developers are only going to cater to them...in fact I would like to believe that people that spend like that help fund the developer so they can update games in other areas if they are doing it right.

This is the grindiest game I have played by far, so to me, being able to earn a few treasure keys a day without spending money seems like a big bonus to me and honestly feels like a great reward for the amount of hours that I have logged in.

First you'd get an influx of people trying a new no MTX RS3. It'll be people who have played in the past, OSRS players, and plenty of people who hear about it from word of mouth. You absolutely know if Jagex released MTX free servers EVERYONE would hear about it, I can already picture the reaction videos to such news. 

If the RS3 player base expands, regardless of if its split between two places, the RS3 team will get more resources and continue to follow this new plan. As someone from OSRS, if the devs get more freedom to do the things they want without having to waste time on MTX, the game will get DRASTICALLY better. 

If it gets drastically better, people will follow. Many will probably go to the new servers, but others will either go there and get bored and go back to an old account from many years ago to skip grinding levels and such.

This is a statement which always confuses me. I understand that, technically, ""unchangeable"" Highscores do exist (for example, locking yourself into a specific place of the leaderboards for your total xp, until a new skill comes out to raise that cap). But other Highscores (e.g. ""Combat Achievement Mastery"", unofficial boss speed kill leaderboads, etc.) are ones that you will always be able to compete in (or become able, if new strategies are found or powercreep is added to the game), once you achieve the requirements to do so (for example, the right stats/gear/unlocks for competing in speed kills).

Can MTX quicken the journey towards fulfilling the requirements to compete (e.g. xp to get your combat levels up quicker, or getting and selling Bonds for ingame gold)? For sure. But it is not required, so in my eyes you are not ""always a step behind no matter what"".

---

So, could you elaborate where you feel like you would always be a step behind? Though one which can't also be allocated to simply having started the game later than others. Btw, just thought I would mention it, but when a new skill comes out, bonus xp for said skill is disabled and no monetization for it will exist for a foreseeable amount of time. Therefore, the only advantages in a new-skill-race is your budget and how much time you have on your hands.

---

I guess I can see the appeal of being able to quickly jump into a competition (for example, OSRS leagues, where everyone starts at the same time, and you can compete for stuff like total league points, how quick you unlock certain stuff, etc.), rather than playing for a while until you reach the point of being able to compete. But for those things, I feel like Leagues are a good middle ground. They combine the ability to immediately start competing with the advantage of NOT permanently dividing the player base.

Other than those special modes, I just don't see an already long existing MMO being the kind of game that should conform to the idea of being able to compete quickly. That train left a long long time ago, when the game first launched. MMOs can still provide competions in some cases, upon reaching the requirements necessary to do so (e.g. the aforementioned boss speed kill leaderboards, or having the budget for the race of a new skill coming out).",2025-06-26 13:07:15,2

Sorry but the playerbase in RS3 has peaked. It's literally the point of the video. RS3 is losing revenue. It's losing members.

You're saying no to this because it would split a playerbase but the players that a new server would attract have already said in surveys that they have no interest in playing RS3 otherwise.

These players that would start on those new servers arent part of the playerbase. They arent part of the community. Because they do not play RS3 currently.

Calling this a betrayal is bloody laughable. If they don't take drastic action, THAT will be the death of the game.
The fact that so many people that claim to love RS3 and want it to continue are so insanely desperate to prevent potentially thousands of new players joining because they want a new server that doesn't have 20 years of MTX P2W features lingering is laughable.

If you do MTX free worlds and then legacy servers still have MTX on legacy then yea, it would probably happen. 

Truthfully, while removing MTX will probably restore a lot of good will and bring players back, it won't bring in players like fresh start worlds will. As someone who was there for both OSRS launch and WoW Classic, there is NOTHING like the launch of fresh servers of something that could really use it. It automatically makes the game more social. Playing along side the community is amazing. Sure you can start fresh on the existing worlds, but the experience for a returning player or a new player is NOWHERE near as amazing as it is when everyone else is starting fresh too. 

If I had to make a guess, if they were to announce the remove of all MTX and fresh start worlds for that. Far more people would come back to RS3 than if they just removed MTX. Especially if a few big streamers decide to play on the new worlds. People would FLOCK to them. I'd even wager that the community you are afraid of splitting would also get bigger instead of smaller. Plenty of people would go back to old accounts because they don't want to start over. I know so many people who have RS3 accounts they haven't touched in many years that would probably play the game if they removed MTX. Some would make new characters while others would go back to old ones. 

I don't know about anyone else, but as someone who has spent FAR more time on OSRS the last decade than RS3. Hearing that MTX is might be removed warms my heart and gives me hope for the game. Makes me want to maybe even log on my account and play again. The idea of fresh servers without MTX is an INSTANT sell to me.

Legacy interface should honestly be the default interface, with the option of adding more action bars which it currently does not have. The current interface could be called ""Advanced Interface"" which new players could try, and immediately turn off if they don't like it.

There's a lot more if you care to ACTUALLY research the game before you sit there smugly telling people ""just ignore it lol"". I've played since I was 10, and I'm 31 now.

You think they're overhauling their monetisation strategy *for a laugh*?

>If anything, they could reduce the grind in some ways to make the EXP bonuses less necessary.

HAHAHAHA. Sorry, that's genuinely a hilarious take. If you do not like grinds, Runescape is not for you. Grinding has always been the essence of Runescape. If you think RS3 has a grind, go try OSRS for a bit and let me know how you get on. The grind HAS reduced over time in RS3. OSRS is objectively grindier. It has very little in the way of MTX, no Treasure Hunter, etc. If you get XP in OSRS, it's because you went and did a skilling activity, not because you bought an XP lamp and not because you got proteans or any other skilling item. It is a huge grind. And yet, OSRS is far and away more popular than RS3. Why do you think that might be? Part of the reason people want rid of XP based MTX is to get back to the root of what Runescape is and always has been - a grind. A grind that feels less satisfying when there's someone beside you popping XP lamps they paid for. A grind that feels less satisfying when the game is trying to goad you into paying for keys.

And because the GP is just shifting between players, the GP you earn playing the game is not devalued.

People said something VERY similar when OSRS first launched and today it has 100k players more than RS3.

Did you participate in either the OSRS launch or the WoW Classic launch? Those were two of the most magical gaming experiences of my life. The sense of community and how social they were is something that is hard to explain. I think players would absolutely FLOCK to new worlds in a completely different manner than them just removing MTX. I know I would. Players could create new accounts on the current RS3, but the experience they will have and the memories that they create would be FAR different than a fresh start server.

> What you are not taking into consideration is the loss of current RS3 players caused from server segregation.

Don't get me wrong, I understand your concern about splitting the player base. I've experienced that many times in my life from old Call of Duty games releasing map packs to MMORPGs launching expansions that exclude players who don't buy the expansions. I'm pretty much ALWAYS against splitting the playerbase, but here my opinion is a bit different.

I honestly don't think the legacy servers would have a population decrease if fresh start worlds were launched. I think it would increase. I firmly believe that if RS3 suddenly got rid of the ""don't touch that MTX game with a 10ft pole"" stigma and did fresh start worlds, the population would SKYROCKET overnight. Possibly to even OSRS levels because people would see oh hey RS3 is actually a pretty amazing game if you look past the MTX. While the fresh start worlds would be the destination of an overwhelming amount of new players and even plenty of old players who want to join in on the new server, there will be 25 years of people who check out their old accounts. Hell we could even see parents give old accounts to their kids if it becomes a hit with a younger audience.

I might be wrong, and sorry for the long rants, the idea of fresh start worlds has really got me intrigued in RS3 again. So I appreciate if you actually took the time to read my long rant. I definitely don't want your game to suffer and decline just so I can start fresh, so if they did some polls and things and found that to be the case, I'm happy with another solution as well. I just think that fresh start servers would be a net positive for RS3 as a whole.",2025-06-27 04:30:23,4

There's so many people saying they would return if they could have a brand new original server to start fresh on and you say no because.... Reasons?

Why would maxed accounts switch? Why would people that have played 20 years on an account start again? There's no logic to that.

This addition of adding new servers where everyone starts at the beginning has been added to many MMOs recently and has caused a huge uptick in subscription numbers to those MMOs.
It never kills off the original servers though, those servers are still as healthy as before.

If the option is potentially thousands of people interested in starting a new RS3 account on a new server vs those same people not playing RS3 ever, why would you want to deny that increase in members?

Rewatch the video. RS3 is circling the drain. They're desperate to turn the game around because it's losing revenue and players.

There is no balance for BXP. It's BXP -- BONUS xp. It doesn't need to exist, and the game doesn't need to cater to it. 

The EXP methods in the game are already INSANELY fast, making them double has no benefit to anyone who isn't already disinterested in playing. 

> If some people would rather purchase bxp (or to a lesser extent seek out non buyable bxp) so that they can spend less time grinding skills and more time doing an activity they find more engaging, what’s the issue with that? Not everyone enjoys skilling to the same extent.

There are MANY issues with that. 

First and foremost, achievement and recognized value -- a psychological concept. When something requires actual time, patience, effort, etc. to achieve, then it becomes something of value and therefore more people seek to achieve it FOR that recognition, this is how all aspirational content in every single game ever works.

That's why an agility skillcape in RS3 is meaningless, but an agility skillcape in OSRS is still seen as pretty damn impressive. 

Second, the issues with resource balancing. When you can just swipe and ignore an entire skill, then that skill lacks the output needed, and Jagex has to find roundabout ways to implement those items into the economy (hence why we wound up in the bossing situation we're at).

If you don't like skilling, then Runescape is not for you. Go play WoW.

The beating heart of Runescape is the way different skills interconnect with each other and the game itself -- being able to ignore that is functionally dismantling the principles of the game in favor of just... impatience and greed. It's sad.

Nowadays players power through content of a game and quickly run out of things to do. Game companies can't match the amount of content people who come from other successful MMOs expect. RS3 doesn't have that problem, there is almost 3 decades of content and the gameplay style is perfect for long grinds. Its perfect for someone wanting to find a new long term game. 

While it would be a second identical RS3, the big difference is that it would still be a different game for everyone else than what it was in the past. Both versions if they remove MTX. So that in itself is a HUGE reason to come back for a lot of people. I can see RS3 removing MTX making huge waves in the gaming industry as whole. I can see a huge amount of people being interested in seeing a game known for insane MTX suddenly removing it. If I never played the game, I'd be interested to see how a game could remove that and still survive. 

On top of that, people love starting fresh along side a bunch of others. If OSRS and Wow Classic aren't enough of an example, then how about WoW Hardcore realms or OSRS Leagues. People would absolutely be down to start over and compete for firsts and just the overall experience as a whole. 

That doesn't mean they would be crapping on the OG players, plenty of players will go back to their old accounts that they haven't played since whatever update burned them whether it was free trade being removed, EoC, TH and the rest of MTX.

This isn't how active concurrency is measured. The larger a concurrent demographic, the larger the non-concurrent demographic is, do you understand?

Those are earned in game. 

Get rid of features that are buyable on a cash shop.

>If achievement and recognition value are all your care about, then again Jagex should remove every single afk method from the game.

The balance of AFK to active methods depends on the amount of exp given by the afk method as opposed to the active method. Take a peek at OSRS and the way it manages that. 

The reality is, there's a balance to it, and yeah, having too many AFK methods certainly devalues the achievement of leveling a skill. I think I reached 90 slayer last I played RS3 without doing a single slayer task thanks to the dailies/weeklies.

It really hasn't, not to this extent. The issues present in 2010 are dwarfed by those today.

That is not true at all.

This is like saying a Rune Scimitar is meaningful in RS3 because it offers a benefit over an adamant one. Sure, but that doesn't make it an achievement in the sense we're talking about. 

An agility skillcape in RS3 is meaningless not just because the skill is meaningless, but because the methods through which you acquire that item is meaningless.

Meanwhile, RC, for example, is a fairly meaningless skill in OSRS. Same with Smithing. Yet an RC cape is certainly one that is seen as an achievement. 

>You’re acting like people loooove skilling in RS3, but that’s just not the reality.

It's not about loving or hating something, it's about recognizing its place in the game.

The reason why people love PvM and not skilling in RS3 is because the only people fucking playing RS3 are those who do. You can't scare away all the hoes and complain about how there ain't no hoes at your party, lil homie. 

Also, PvM isn't even that popular considering less than 10% of the playerbase has even downed Zammy 100%.

Yet still I read on reddit every other promo that some guy spent X thousand keys and did not hit that 0,5% chance for X item whilst he spent a fortune in IRL or Ingame cash to buy keys. But in the GE said item costs like 100m coins or less. Why are people being ignorant on purpose and THEN blame the game for what it offers?",2025-06-27 19:40:31,1

You're just objectively wrong. But go off. 

99 Agility and 99 rc DO have prestige in OSRS. More so than Maxing does in RS3. Especially on a main. It's not even arguable, lmao, there are less people with 99 RC than there are maxed in RS3. As of Jan. 2024 anyway. 

>These skills aren't new, they're not ""hard"". It takes 2 years to gain -just- 20k in every skill every day and be maxed, or 4 years to do it every other day. OSRS has been out for 12 years.

Yes, that's an achievement, btw. Spending 2 years incrementally training a skill IS an achievement in a game like RS. I get that RS3 players are unfamiliar with the concept of actually grinding a skill, but yes -- that is certainly impressive. 

>The only players with any amount of clout are chunkers, UIM, or OSAAT, and even then, those are the complete extremes of players.

I don't think Chunkers have any clout unless they have a series, since no one can even tell you are a chunker or what you've done with that.

However, I agree, UIM certainly have more clout if they make it far. 

You do realize that clout isn't a binary, right? Not black and white. Getting 99rc is impressive much like getting maxed on a UIM is, too. one more so than the other.

But by your own logic, maxing on a UIM isn't impressive either since it's just getting a small amount of exp every day for years? lmao.",2025-06-25 22:46:33,2

Off the numbers of players currently playing at any given time isn’t the 20X, you saying OSRS just play A LOT less hours per day than RS3 players? Is that your angle?

Your name really fits. You are a goober, lmao.

How are you not understanding how scale works. 

Let me ask you a basic reasoning question. 

There are 10 concurrent players on one game, and 100 concurrent players on a different game **during peak hours**. 

With this in mind, do you think that the first game has exactly 10% of the playercount of the second game? Or is the second game's playercount demonstrative of a larger grouping of players that currently aren't playing? 

>Like I said, haven’t played OSRS. It’s just that’s the only thing that makes sense.

The only thing that makes sense to you is that OSRS, a growing MMO that is unbelievably successful, is SO boring that people watch youtube videos and therefore the youtube videos have a lot more views?

Are you 12 years old?

Compete with...? What are you talking about?

>ilies and weeklies aren’t buyables, so what difference is there between using dailies/weeklies to level a skill and using buyable bonus xp?

Dailies are their own issue in the game that I want to see removed. 

>Less than 10% of the player base hasn’t completed 100% zammy? It’s almost like that’s an end game boss with a bunch of mechanics and needing pretty high end gear.

Okay so what, most players are AFK Glacor? lmao. 

>Achieving something is fun, and some people don’t see skilling as that source of fun. 

You're right, achieving something IS fun, even when the process of achieving it isn't. Do you think it's fun doing 1000 glacor kills? No. Grinding anything gets tedious, but the output is worthwhile.

That doesn't apply to skilling anymore. 

> If you find the skilling to be fun, you’re under no obligation to purchase that boost, and unless you only get “fun” by comparing yourself to others, you can get as much fun as you could if that buyable didn’t exist.

Again, reverting back to the argument that was already argued against because you can't actually engage with player psychology.

Yes, it's not as fun doing something when there is a way to completely skip it with a credit card. Shocker. This is literally WHY people don't like P2W in games.

I can assure you that bonds do not, in fact, create any inflation whatsoever, and even helps with deflation through the 10% conversion fee.

Your critisism about bonds allowing players to buy gear/supply is still valid, but it does not create an inflation in price, just a temporary imbalance on the supply/demand chain causing prices to rise.

No, skilling, like anything, is not a PERSONAL achievement in a MULTIPLAYER persistent world. You are absolutely delusional. Every action impacts everything else -- that is how multiplayer games work, that is how multiplayer games with OPEN ECONOMIES work.

By being able to skip all skills, skills cease to provide the needed output to be an economic force -- the beating heart of runescape is the interconnectedness of its skilling systems, and that simply does not fucking exist in RS3 because of people like you. 

>Idgaf what level you have in x skill, and you’re not going to care what level I have.

I don't think you understand what an MMO is. An MMO isn't just when you group up with other people, it's when you, virtually, live in another world WITH people, and much like in any persistent world, their actions impact you, whether you do them together or not.

That's why Skilling, being a solo activity, still impacts... the economy, which effects everyone that isn't an Ironman. Do you understand?

That isn't actually even remotely close to what I was saying. Lets try again, with literacy this time.

I don't care if it forces you to do anything. What I like is **earning something in game**.

BXP in the sense that WE are talking about it -- from MTX, gambling, etc. -- is NOT earned in game. It distinctly exists SEPERATE from the game itself. Which is the problem.

Now, if Jagex wanted to add stars to like... a drop table or something and NOT sell them in a cash shop, then fine. 

But as long as they exist in ANY form outside of the game itself, it's an issue. 

>Fear of missing out is not limited to daily resetting activities. It applies to anything that is time exclusive. If you miss a birdhouse run, you can never regain that potential loot.

By this logic, every single thing you do in your entire life is FOMO, lmao. That isn't AT ALL how anyone talks about Fomo except pedantic weirdos on reddit.

When we say FOMO, we mean systems designed by developers to insentivize repeated engagement. Birdhouses are designed like the farming skill was -- that is not Fomo, lmao.

>Except we’re not talking about new players, we’re talking about overall player count. Considering RS3 is trending downward, it means current players are leaving, and lack of transparency is a very frequently mentioned reason.

Really doesn't matter too much. I don't think Jagex should be focused on retaining current players, it should focus on bringing in new players. Of course, retaining players is fine, but the amount that are currently being retained aren't sustainable. 

>I absolutely understand what an MMO is, that doesn’t mean that every single aspect of every single piece of content is always multiplayer centric.

Yes, it actually... is. That's the entire point of an MMO. Everything you do and experience is simultaneous in a persistent world inhabited by other people. The things you say, do, and engage with are that. 

>That’s just not the reality, and the fact is, ironman and main accounts alike, could max an account without ever interacting with another player.

Again, no. Your understanding of an MMO is so narrow that it only accounts for, what, group activities? That at no point is even 5% of what an MMO could or should be. 

>Every single resource could be collected without buying anything on the ge or trading with other players. So fundamentally, skilling is not reliant on anyone else, and my skilling achievements have no bearing on anyone else unless I choose to purchase items from someone else.

Talk about not engaging in reality.

Just because everything CAN be obtained this way doesn't mean it SHOULD be obtained this way, nor does it mean it IS obtained this way.

Just because it CAN, doesn't mean it IS. 

>Ironman is an example that is definitely not a minority. So show me how your ironman account is affected by someone else’s decision to buy bonus xp.

An Ironman is, by definition, a minority. Far less than 50% of the users in the game are ironmen, lmao. 

My Ironman isn't affected by someone's decision to buy EXP, thankfully, because my achievements on an Ironman are seen as seperate from the achievements of MTX-driven mainscapers. 

Thankfully.

However, most people do not play Ironman, nor should they have to for the integrity of the game to be even remotely sound.

Birdhouses are by literal definition repeat engagement.  They are absolutely no different than daily challenges.  Acting like they are is drawing weird lines in the sand for what is and isn’t a time based repeated activity. 

Jagex needs to focus on both.  And there are much more pressing things like the absolutely horrid tutorial and lack of clear introduction to skills.  Necro and Arch have done it well, but newer skills need to get some sort of treatment like that.

Except there exists plenty of single player content in runescape.  There are solo bosses, quests, etc.  an mmo does not automatically make things that are inherently single player into multiplayer.  They are still single player aspects that exist within a broadly multiplayer game.

I never said it should be obtained purely through solo means, I said that it can be.  Meaning your gameplay experience is only tied to others as much as you choose to make it.

I never said ironman was a majority, but it’s a substantial portion of active accounts, and is a clear example of how direct buyable bxp is not automatically impacting the gameplay of other people.  If the only reason you assign any value to your achievements is the fact that you physically cannot buy bxp, then your problem has nothing to do with mtx.  Your problem has to do with the fact that you can’t have fun unless other people think you’re good at the game. News flash for you, the majority of players don’t give a single crap about what you do on your account.  

Sorry you’re right, you didn’t imply it, you said it flat out.  You specifically said you think leveling is too easy in rs3.  Xp methods are only as fast as they are because of bonus xp.  So you’re saying that the xp rate of every method in the game should theoretically be cut in half. Purely because YOU think that xp rates are too high.  Once again, if you think that’s the case, fine, don’t use any bxp at all.  I’ll loose absolutely no sleep over that.  But forcing that onto anyone else is absurd and just shows that you don’t want anyone to be able to have fun unless it’s how you think fun should be defined. Telling people that the way they want to have fun isn’t valid is the perfect definition of gatekeeping and is exactly what you are doing.",2025-06-29 17:16:23,1

>Believe it or not, daily challenges are in fact integrated into the game.

No, they aren't. They are a piece of UI that asks you to do something that is integrated into the game. 

A quest, for example, is a bespoke story and narrative that is only experienced within the context of the game itself. While a Daily Challenge is a UI option that you can click to to see how you should play the game for a little bit.

This isn't how an open economy works. It's not about limitations of items, it's about how many people are actually obtaining said item in the first place.

It has a very abject bearing on my ability to enjoy skilling -- that's because my enjoyment of skilling is an emotional experience I am telling you I am experiencing (or did experience when I played) -- lmao. How are you struggling this hard to comprehend this?

Daily challenges are part of the game, you can interact with npcs to toggle certain challenges, you can accumulate skips and gain rewards from it. It incentivizes you to engage with skills.  And it gives rewards for those interactions. 

No you haven’t.  You’ve stated that other people playing the game how they want makes you feel less accomplishment when you play your account how you choose.  That’s a you problem.  I could say that someone else not having a job and being able to no life the game makes me feel less accomplishment, doesn’t mean Jagex should force other people to only play outside of working hours.

People choose to obtain an item based on supply and demand, so it’s 100% how an open economy works.  If something is in demand, and supply is low, the price goes up so it becomes more profitable to obtain that item and sell it.  More demand makes price go down.  The fact of the matter is that most expensive skilling related items require resources that are limiting to that skilling method.  Such as hydrix/alchemical hydrix for high level crafting jewelry.  Your saying that the best way to resolve this is make leveling slower for everyone.  If anything that’ll make bossing more profitable (even though it’s already most of the best profit in the game) and final materials cheaper.  So skilling will actually be worse off.  

Last time I checked, the skills and quests are what make RS so unique in the mmo landscape, those still exist and are still core to the game.  Should Jagex also not add any new content to existing skills? That would also affect your emotional connection to the skills.  I’m not saying you can’t feel a certain way, I’m saying that taking your personal feelings and forcing that upon everyone else arbitrarily is wrong.


Funny, there are plenty of reasons the game is dying, predatory mtx is one of them.  But taking that crusade and saying all mtx in any form should be removed is quite frankly ignoring reality and makes it less likely Jagex does anything. If players are just going to continue to complain about things like direct purchases of cosmetics, than why should Jagex even try?

Which doesn't really happen with low to mid-level skilling supplies because these levels can be skipped by doing dailies and chugging lamps/keys. 

>Last time I checked, the skills and quests are what make RS so unique in the mmo landscape, those still exist and are still core to the game.

Yes, they ""exist"". But Skills in RS3 are barely functioning. They're outlets for AFK training and hourly/daily challenges that allow you to skip through them on a whim.

My friend quit RS3 Ironman last year after him and I played for a while because he felt like all of the skills he had at 90-99 he barely trained due to the abundance of EXP given out elsewhere. 

>Funny, there are plenty of reasons the game is dying, predatory mtx is one of them. But taking that crusade and saying all mtx in any form should be removed is quite frankly ignoring reality and makes it less likely Jagex does anything.

Cope all you want, but yes, MTX is part of why the game is dying. PART. 

The endless deluge of hourlies, dailies, weeklies, and monthlies is another reason.

The disgusting, garish elements of the cosmetic overrides is another.

The obtuse early game is another.

There are many reasons why the game has stagnated and/or begun to die. 

Turning the game from a slot machine into JUST P2W that continues to devalue all skilling achievements is an improvement, but I promise you, it ain't saving anything.

First - it's a step in the right direction.  Moving away from direct xp dumps to bonus xp is definitely healthier since it requires players to still engage in the main game and helps address the issue with skilling supplies not being consumed.

I agree with the other players - one week is a bit too short a time window and it would've been nicer to see a two week (minimum) window but even one week is at least going to give some indication of the impact of the changes.

I can't really comment on the bundles as an ironman, although I do feel like they are overly generous (£10 for millions in bxp via the stars feels a tad over the top). Not sure how that compares to the promos jagex have done (I remember some of those multiplier events gave a shitload of stars so maybe this isn't as OP as it sounds).

Long time player, started from Classic and I've felt semi-shafted as the games aged progressively. I ended up quitting RS3 maybe after December the year before last? Not due to a lack of content, there's a TON of it and I understand you guys need to make a profit, but due to the aggressive MTX.

I'm sure you don't need to hear this yourself, you're well aware of how temperamental the community can be (Including myself), but if this doesn't work in the favor of players in the long run after testing or gets shelved like other projects have, I'll consider this the final nail in the coffin for any chance of coming back to the game I loved so much growing up.

I know myself as a standalone doesn't mean much, but I can only say I was a huge Jagex supporter from childhood through to adulthood and I'd love to sink my teeth back into an MMO that's not as hardcore as OSRS but caters to a now older casual.",2025-07-01 13:31:46,9

Positives:

- anything to replace the predatory TH gambling system with straightforward MTX is better
- the buyable xp is bonus rather than straight up

Negatives:

- leaving buyable xp in the game at all is a massive infringement on game integrity which is off-putting 
- leaving such straightforward pay to win mechanics in the game will not help the reputation of RS3 (osrs players will continue to trash it)
- MOST IMPORTANTLY: the argument about helping ""people who dont have as much time to play"" is almost insulting to the intelligence of the playerbase. If you pay money to play a game less, it demonstrates that the company doesn't have faith in its game and that it is a waste of time to play since you are paying money to fast track it. MTX has the INVERSE effect on the mentality of a working adult, if a game is a waste of time to play to the point where you need to buy your way through it, they will lose interest faster.",2025-07-01 14:13:43,9

This relates to the treasure hunter experiment because I don't think that a week is nearly long enough to see any real player behaviour change.

Another immediate issue that I see is that we're not going to be able to see truly how people interact with the game without daily keys etc. if we're just going to be getting them at the end of the experiment anyway?

For ten bucks, if I'm understanding correctly, you can get 35 keys (close enough). The expected roll of a key, without a promotion, is a yellow, which is often a lamp or a star, but is also sometimes other odds and ends like divine things.


My suspicion is that you are selling MORE xp for the same price than with treasure hunter, perhaps eliminating a gambling component. I remain thoroughly unconvinced that this model is better. The probabilities are on the wiki and I'll do the math when I get to my office to see what the expected xp yield is, counting bxp as half.


On the third hand, having this xp only be bought and not tied to a daily log in bonus will significantly reduce the amount flowing in to the game, even if an individual sale of xp is bigger than under TH.

I think giving players control over what they'd like to spend their time (and money) on is a much better approach to MTX, than the random chance that treasure hunter currently does.


A direct sale approach would also likely be received better. I honestly think you guys should rework solomons store, and add a full rotation cycle.

1. Treasure hunter gets severly toned down, no more cosmetics, lamps and Gp from it.

2. Cosmetics will still be a thing but comes from runecoins or loyalty points or even better actually earned ingame instead of Treasure hunter

3. Reduced amount of bonus xp you get from Stars. Right now i feel like you get way to much bonus xp from stars.

4. Ties a bit in with number 2, but more earnable cosmetics from ingame, from say bosses, replayable quests, slayer, skilling (heck we have a whole crafting skill, why not utilize that to create cosmetics)

5. figured i would add this, i love runescape both rs3 and osrs, so its been very sad to see the state rs3 has ended up in. Hope we come out from this with serious change.

Also as someone who works full time and studies upwards of 20 hours a week outside of work, Id say I fall into your category of ""players with less time"" and engaging with TH or MTX simply is not a solution for me, and not something I want or feel I need to engage in.  


I play RS3 over OSRS for a number of reasons, but honestly the main one being the speed at which you can make impactful progress on your account vs the alternative, I don't need TH or bonus XP to further enhance that. I make the choice to speed up my progress by doing more active yet faster xp yielding training methods vs slower but afkable when I'm online and that for me is the beauty of this game, not the ability to whip out my card and buy my way there, It's perfectly achievable for this to be your route towards supporting this aspect of the playerbase more - directly through how you engage with the game itself when playing.   


Appreciate you're not gonna please everyone and I'm just a small segment of the audience, but ultimately I have made choices in my life that result in me having fewer spare hours than the average person, I don't want or expect special treatment for that as this is my choice and circumstance and I instead organise my time and activities in accordance with this, if people with less time wanna play your game, it's totally doable without pulling out the credit card for BXP.",2025-07-01 15:13:40,4

These feel really bad to see. Are they better for the game than Treasure Hunter? Unquestionably. But they still are triggering that response of ""this game is p2w, this game is dictated by your wallet, why bother playing.""

It feels like instead of taking that final step needed for integrity and a change in image, we're stopping 4/5ths of the way. If these remain, I don't think the games reputation will recover nearly as much as if they don't. The concern that drives people away and stops people from wanting to try the game, remain.

I understand there need to be methods to reasonably progress even with less time. Thats more than reasonable. It just can't exist in a paid form.

The first is the time frame, which has already been brought up a lot. 1 week to ""hold out on TH"" is not very long. As an example, let's say someone is wanting to buy some keys to work towards accessing prif. Since they can't buy keys for a week, they can either buy bxp and train the skill themselves or start doing the other quests while waiting for TH to come back. If it were 2-4 weeks, that's a lot more ""waiting"" time in there to make them feel more pushed to train the skills themselves. (Not to mention, a lot of people probably already have stacked up dummies and proteans in their bank to use up). 

Point 2 is how we're saving all earned keys anyway so we can still redeem all of them right after TH comes back. We're not disabling treasure hunter if we're still gathering keys. Integrity for the game is not just about buying keys, it's also how many free keys we get from daily things, premier, quests etc. Treasure hunter itself puts the game in a bad state with (again) how many proteans and free exp come into the game, neglecting the need for resources. This experiment feels more about calculating the cost of having a bxp alternative to treasure hunter rather than how ""disabling treasure hunter"" would affect the game.

Point 3 is about this bxp you can buy. This is just a small point, but I'd be interested to see how many of those people that buy up these stars (every day or not) end up actually using the exp versus holding onto it and getting it used up via more th promos in the future. I have a feeling most people will, purposely or not, end up getting phoenix lamps from TH and use it up that way - unless the next dxp comes first, some may use it up there.

Overall, I still approve. These are just some concerns I'm thinking about. I'm still tentative about the whole thing because of our history and it can be so incredibly easy to turn around the data and say ""Well, people just want treasure hunter so we gotta leave it in as is. This is what the game has become.""",2025-07-01 19:28:45,2

Guardian World Pass would include:
Revitalizing/reviving OLD and Dead Content to where we need to complete Castle Wars to progress on the pass. Create a progression where old content WILL be used again. To not missed out or confuse players. The content needed will be global and same on all passes and updated each month. Different passes - synced progression on what players need to get done.

At the end of the Guardian World Pass, we need multiple servers to defeat a World/Server Boss for the end, where players with passes or not can receive Pass loot and/or without pass loot.

On another note:
Since they released Fort Forinthry, they must open up the Wilderness and create events up north to where an “attack” will be made on the Fort and if the monsters are successful it will expand the Wilderness and TURN ON pvp and OFF as the achievements are done.

Starting with a few points.

There’s not really a winning solution to this when involving Premier Clubbers or people who don’t read news posts into the equation - but I think that personally, if the experiment is supposed to simulate “No Treasure Hunter” and how players are supposed to behave during that scenario - that allowing TH keys to build up in the background or be earned during this time defeats the purpose. If this results in a future test - a better solution is to offer “compensation” in the form of MTX currency that will be available in such a “No TH” scenario - such as Runecoins. This kind of highlights my issue with these “experiments” as a whole. They seemingly are the easiest path taken every time to simulate the environment they are aiming to emulate - but the result is that it fails to do so either because the game doesn’t go far enough OR runs into conflicting objectives (A mass cosmetic dump vs cosmetic free worlds for example - as some players have voiced that they aren’t inclined to purchase cosmetics if other players can turn them off.)

Two - other players have gotten to this, but a singular week feels too short. I’ll give you guys that it’s possible to have a general idea of how players feel after that time, but it again fails to provide time for players to adapt to the test environment - especially if they don’t need to because daily keys still technically exist.

Finally, I think you’re going to have a situation where you will need to decide if you value the growth of the game or the satisfaction of existing players with regards to for-purchase BXP (which I LOVE that it is limited to bxp - it’s good to encourage players actually playing the game.)

Current players in my circle often consist of adults who don’t have much time to play - which means that they either do purchase keys or farm their daily keys as a primary part of their play session.

By contrast, the survey indicates that a majority of lapsed players have concerns about XP MTX. I think a lot of those players come from Old School RuneScape, which is always going to be a looming shadow over RS3 in regards to buyable xp in any form because it’s wildly successful without offering it at all.

Personally, I would rather see no purchasable XP in any form, as an adult with little time to play, because when I do play, I still tend to play like I did when RS was a massive time sink as a kid even if my available time prohibits gain in progress. That’s the quintessential “RuneScape” experience to me. But MTX has been around to fast track folks for over a decade, so it’s baked in for many other existing players. I don’t think Jagex can fence sit with this one.",2025-07-01 16:00:20,3
MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1loxe8u/mtx_experiment_1_disabling_th_july_22_28/,1loxe8u,n0s6nvv,Sesylya,"I can tell you already that it won't impact me much. I like my free 6 keys a day (vip/dailies), especially when they give me lamps, but I've never bought any. I keep my earned keys stocked up to 90 so I have a buffer in case of any particularly appealing promo--you threw so many millions of bxp at me during the Christmas event that I burned almost all my buffer keys on the next Phoenix Lamps promo lol--but I still pretty much only use those 6 a day.

As I'm already 110 all and my current goal is slowly training my synchronized att/str/def from 119 to 120, I won't be buying bxp bundles as the only one divisible by 3 is the medium and I don't really need it anyway. I don't think I've ever used a knowledge bomb in my life, mostly due to being maxed long before they were introduced, and also because I just don't often grind skills for hours anymore.

I don't think this Experiment is going to have anything like the result some redditors think it is. They hate TH and whales, but I suspect they vastly overestimate how many people buy how many keys. I would bet there's a lot of quiet players like me out there, who are content to use their free keys every day and then just close TH and go on with the game.

I think TH should not be removed yet, maybe another time, but for now it definitely at least needs to be reworked due to being too xp-heavy. With that being said, TH is also the only reason I decided the 120-all grind was something I could actually do after I'd comped. The extra xp assistance was the only thing that made that goal seem attainable to me. And even with the 'massive' amounts of xp it offers without purchasing keys, other than occasional oddment dumps, it still takes a few additional years of grinding, without buying keys, using my 6 daily keys as a premier member with daily challenges, to go from true maxed 99s and 120s, to 120-all.

I'd probably say it's in a good spot in that regard, for how long this game takes to really play.. and I'm not against allowing purchase of additional keys, because I'm pretty indifferent about mtx in a game, especially one like runescape, where the grind for xp can take such a long time.. It's not unreasonable to me. but the numbers people can buy are out of control.

I do think it's important to keep some of the xp drops as an extra motivation for players to keep returning to the game as well. A few suggestions I have are.. You can remove Huge, Giant, and Special lamps. The Large lamps and stars will be plenty. Remove more xp-heavy events from TH's rotation, maybe give more rotations on the cosmetic events. And possibly bring back randomized skill-specific stars and lamps so farming prismatics to dump in one skill isn't an option.",2025-07-03 03:51:21,4

Oddments DEFINITELY need to replace Earned Keys as challenge rewards, **especially during the experiment.** Adjusting the amount provided by Daily Challenges will be something much easier to adjust, to fine tune it.

Great thinking and many gratz for the risk you guys are taking. What I do not understand is the shortness of the time period ( a week) to see what the effect will be from disabling TH. Seems a bit short to get a deeper understanding of the possible effects.   
Personally, I don't mind th being disabled ( never bought keys nor do I intend to do so).   
The major issue in game is the simple existance of proteans. Get those out will make skilling great again, e. g herblore, wich used to be an expensive skill to train. You need to farm herbs or buy them, wich made farming a profitable skill. With proten shakes, that kinda blew things up didn't it?   
Looking forward to dive in to the experiments, especially DXP wich will really show the ingame effects of the measures taken. So atm, farming tons of herbs :) 

One small question remains : When will the no proteans dxp take place ( August or autumn).

Many thanks for the hard work and exquisite com. Have a great one",2025-07-01 22:11:10,1

I guess you could say I've been running a bit of a personal Experiment myself since the Easter Event this year. I'd been avoiding Necromancy like the plague (pun intended), but finally relented when an Easter Egg clue pointed to the City of Um. After completing the tutorial, I wondered how far I could get in Necromancy without actually doing any necromancy, so I started redeeming all Lamps and Stars from Treasure Hunter towards Necromancy. As of today I just reached level 61 in Necromancy having only completed the tutorial, with the rest of it coming from Treasure Hunter. And to be honest I get an ickier feeling from that than if I was raising corpses! I guess what I'm trying to say is I feel like Treasure Hunter is way too OP; there's no way I should be making that many gains without actually training the skill.  
  
I understand some players are pressed for time and that microtransactions unfortunately represent a huge chunk of Jagex's (and frankly, the gaming industry at large's) profit margins, so I get that if Treasure Hunter was removed, it'd have to be replaced by \*something,\* hence all this, so I'll try to keep an open mind.",2025-07-01 22:34:38,1

But i've been back a little over a month and I have to say the protean stuff is 'too easy' and I almost wish it was never added, not because it's 'free xp', but because it's stackable, you can sit at the portables and queue up your protean item all while getting extra xp from all sorts of random bombs and drinks and cores and things.

That being said... i'm not against them. people have maxed the game out, completed every skill to 99, 110, or 120, and then even farther for 200m xp, which imo feels rather odd to even allow, because now every skill released to 110-120...is instantly unlocked by anyone with 200m xp in that skill... which removes gameplay for those people, along with anyone with over 104m xp that it takes to 120 a skill (i think).

Protean should be a reward for mini-games involving skilling... bonus xp isn't that bad, since it's just some free xp and you still need to skill quite a lot to gain that bonus xp, but if you have bonus xp AND proteans, that becomes a problem... especially in dxp.  
Don't get me wrong, i would love fast xp and I don't believe i'll hit a few 99's even if we had dxp and protean... but that's why I use dxp for skills like combat... which is a chore to level, with slayer. only bxp and dxp, no proteans for those... but you do still have the dummies, which aren't bad, at least for combat...

  
But the elephant in the room is... we all want that quick xp, but there are those who already hit 200M xp using those methods and... you're now taking that away from players who won't have that option... while the 200m xp players reap the rewards they already have from having used them.

Personally, i'd rather have nicer 110-120 updates... but removing TH, (thankfully we will get all keys we get from daily logins and challenges) will only show that right after it's back, everyone will flock to using keys for either chances at cash items or maybe protean, but i'm more akin to making cash from a rare token drop (that i'll never get anyway)... so proteans it is?

  
For now, though, i'll just wait and see the results... and learn alternative methods of xp gain.",2025-07-02 00:03:27,1

- Step in the right direction, I think a week is a joke though.

- Starting this at the last week of July is definitely a disappointment.

I get needing to be cautious as this is a major revenue source for RuneScape 3 (Thanks to your insistence on it over the last decade rather than content), but changes need to be made faster than this, and with a more meaningful period.

- Again, I had very low hope - And even my tempered, incredibly low expectations, this is even less than that.

I'll keep my eyes peeled, but as of right now I came back on this news, and currently what's being proposed does not bode well for me continuing into August - I don't want to renew my subscription because you've opted to start your ""experiments"" at the absolute tail end of July.

- Thanks for your time, I hope the rest of your experiments go well, I'll play through my existing subscription, but maybe you'll see me again once actual meaningful changes have happened.",2025-07-02 03:49:19,1

Credit where it's due for this level of forethought. It may be a moot point with potential removal pending, but I'd love to see some iteration of that carried forward to current TH (and seasonal events) as well.

IE, doing PVM and killing the boss awards you a key token, meaning you now have no inventory slot for loot, or can't load your preset due to an untradeable item. Destroying it doesn't take much time, but it's unnecessary friction. Similar case when it comes to seasonal event rewards like the Halloween maze multipliers that just pop up in your inventory mid PVM.

Otherwise it will be the same scenario as Oddments where you gave up on the shop too early thinking it would not be profitable in terms of key sales in the future...

You better make the mega drop last more than 2 weeks and continue adding even more on top of what gets dropped in the first chunk because unless you are solely looking at the sales on said cosmetics to decide how popular the method is which you wont be you will only be looking at bond sales / bonds being redeem for RC because goofy you will never get a sheet of paper that looks good enough for corporate.

So don't shoot yourself in the foot by making it last only 2 weeks and having just one massive drop you should also look into allowing players to buy individual pieces to an outfit / set instead of having just the option to buy a full something for a bloated price.

If you allow the purchase of individual pieces you are now able to hit a larger audience and players will now be more likely to interact with said MTX as they now feel like they are getting their moneys worth.

To parrot what others have already said, one week feels a bit too short. From how it reads, it's going to be as if mains get the iron treatment with TH. So no pop up with ""ads"". Maybe a week of not seeing that would garner good feedback (hopefully).

For those that truly do use TH for BXP, bundles might be the right approach! At least it's not just free XP and the player still has to engage with content (even if the time is halved). Any BXP that I got from TH from daily keys was nice and everything else I got is usually destroyed immediately.  
  
I wish \`Cosmetic-Free Worlds\` was more so just a toggle we could have per client instance. I truly don't think there's enough people that care about the ""cosmetic issue"" enough to play on a dedicated world with less people.

so something like a star costs X, members Y, cosmetic Z etc. so I would like to see a direct sales model of items. I don't mind sales and bundles as long as they are reasonable.

direct buy of cosmetics (sick of RNG on cosmetics via keys just sell it to me at a reasonable price and less FOMO)  
  
Direct buy of bxp / dxp time (this can be good for disliked skills, time-limited players, etc)

  
Remove FOMO / RNG for rare items (I don't mind keys, but think they should be scaled back to mostly doing bonus xp vs direct xp, and never put up a cosmetic in it without a way to also direct buy for a resonable price) maybe like 5-10 USD for a cosmetic bundle on a event

removal of dummy proteins etc, from DXP (good for the game long run) tho over my 5 alts (3 maxed) I probably have 500k+ prots to use :(, I would like to see prots stay but use supplies in a lot of cases, so basically turn them into an XP booster vs free XP, or maybe if they act as that item don't give XP and only XP if you have supplies

The honesty and transparency you showed really struck a chord with me, and it was enough to bring me back to the game just to see how things play out with everyone else. I genuinely appreciate the fact that you're willing to acknowledge there’s a problem and even take a potential hit to the bottom line to test out solutions. That takes integrity.

I especially liked the recent bundles you offered with Treasure Hunter disabled. They were clear, fair, and simple: “Pay this amount, get this bonus XP.” No hidden odds, no gambling mechanics. That’s the kind of system I think most of the community can get behind.

That said, I’d like to share a small bit of feedback:

I personally believe that any form of *chance-based* mechanics — especially those tied to progression — should be completely removed from MTX. The moment randomness enters the equation, it stops being fair or transparent, and starts pushing into predatory territory.

Additionally, I’d love to see MTX be limited to bonus XP rather than replacing actual gameplay. Items like proteans and training dummies essentially let players gain XP without engaging with the world, and I think that hurts the game’s liveliness. Imagine how much more populated and vibrant the game would feel if people had to go out and actually *do* the content in the world to train their skills, rather than standing AFK at a dummy.

Anyway, that’s my two cents. Thanks again for opening the dialogue and trying something new. I’m hopeful for what comes next.",2025-07-01 13:13:12,-1

As someone who is maxed (5.8) I don't mind seeing directly purchasable BXP and I think it's a good move forward. I'm not sure what Pricing works out to be appropriate, I'm sure that's data that you all have at Jagex and so I would be a little more generous but not overly generous.

I view directly purchasable XP bombs + BXP as a good change as it gives people more opportunity to train when and how they want to (less focus on DXP weekens). I see it similar to buying a boost much like how WOW allows player character boosts to skip the early grind for a nominal fee. The couple of times I've played I've immediately used them because my time is valuable and I'd rather trade some money to save that time. 

With this change, I would hope that things that currently award keys could be swapped to stars instead (dailies, quests, etc) which could also allow Ironmen to receive these benefits, something they current dont recieve, for some of the worse early level grinds (I'm looking at you Herblore + Agility).

But I'm more than a little concerned about the disabling TH experiment only being a week long. There is zero chance there's going to be any returning players during a single week experiment. So that metric is out. A week isn't really long enough for the current playerbase to notice much of a difference either, so there isn't going to be much to learn from them. 

So I can't really see the experiment achieving anything unless the goal is like the whole ""92% of people engage with the squeal of fortune"" thing from back in the day, to try to justify TH by showing that nothing changed when they removed it other than profits going down. Like what possible positive metric could come out of an experiment only a week long? What's actually going to change in a week?

I hope I'm just missing something though and that there are things I haven't considered that the experiment will show.",2025-07-02 19:35:13,-1

# xp, bonus xp, ways to get xp, things to get xp, utility items for QOL, MONEY, and cosmetics *sometimes*.

I would've loved to see this experiment + dxp experiment combined and last 2 weeks, starting 1 week before DXP and the last week during DXP.

Personally though I would've done that for a month.

If we went down this route in the final proposal, there's nothing saying we wouldn't consider some availability through gameplay if it's a significant point of feedback.

Our current MTX relationship in the game is an odd one, because it's also a part of the experience for people not buying either (unless you are Irons obviously). One of the big things these next two Experiments tell us is - if this stuff didn't exist tomorrow, how does it impact how the experience for everyone? 

It's a big driving force for why Experiments are in the live game. We were (naively) a little surprised how much people valued Daily Challenge Keys when we implemented Hero Pass, so we don't want to repeat that mistake.

Very importantly, if we have an outpouring of ""I miss X or Y"", it won't be an excuse we use to not change things dramatically. But it might be we identify ways to solve replacing what was valued in different ways outside of MTX, in ways that also respects the health / integrity of the game.",2025-07-01 19:57:50,4

P2W MTX has caused this community to crater until what it is now.
That doesn't just mean TH. That means Buyable XP, BXP, all of it.

Just removing TH will not be enough if they want to save this game for 10 years in the future.
I'm seeing the sentiment of ""well, I'd be fine with BXP because I'd buy it to speed up the skills that are awful"".

Well, maybe Jagex should fix the skills and make them enjoyable so that people aren't wanting to buy BXP/XP to help out.

Cosmetic MTX is here to stay, that's going to be a thing, it will be a thing but thats the ONLY MTX that should still be in the game.

If Jagex stand there after all these surveys and experiments and decide ""we'll do away with the gambling TH but we're going full bore into buyables.""

 How long until they are offering tier90 corrupted weapons for a price? How long until they let you buy x amount of resources to speed up your grind?

Although i have a question, is there a reason why we cannot just outright remove the direct sale of bxp and lamps, and instead moving bxp to minigame rewards (ala - barbarian assault/stealing creation/etc) as something that can actually be earned and worked towards thus making it feel rewarding and incentivizing to do and earn? It feels as though this aspect of mtx is also a major point of contention along side proteans.

Or perhaps even something along the lines of prestiging a skill, maybe allowing bxp to work on a skill for the first 99 levels (or 200m) then allowing people to prestige a skill and work towards leveling it up again without the assistance of bxp or what have you. Maybe even leaderboards for prestige tiers, or each tier earns you -5%, -10%, -15%, making it harder to level up each time, challenge tiers ""can only craft with gems/hides this prestige"" etc, and/or a toggle so your original level is still there so if you want to do a new quest with say 90 crafting as a req but you are mid prestige at 70, you can just hit a button to go back to your 'main' level then later on use the button again to continue prestige xp... 

I feel something along these lines could maintain the integrity that some people want as they are asking for a 'reset to the leaderboards' or 'fresh start worlds' etc. That way people can earn their main levels as they see fit, bxp or not, but then prestiging adding a soft reset for leaderboard chasers or what have you. Could also be a colossal boon for a ALOT of the resources and drop tables if suddenly people need 2x 3x, ...10x the gemstones for their prestiges as opposed to one 99/110 etc. 

Apologies for this turning into a ramble about prestiging lol.",2025-07-01 11:40:43,16

Finding a better stream of revenue which is both balanced and feels fair to all players is going to be a challenge. 

Given we're acustomed to new content always being part of the base subscription (one which many feels has risen far quicker than it ought to have), the best way to make up the diference would be to offer unique experiences which feel like they provide genuine value while costing little in development time. (Which I guess is the same niche that SGS and TH was fulfilling)

I'd be very interested to have a genuine discussion on this. Though also sadly I can see the knee-jerk reaction of much of the community making this a very difficult prospect to talk about openly.

The only thing I can think of immediately would be such as one-time fees or subscription costs for alternate game modes. FSW, OSRS-style leagues, etc.

I guess another option would be advanced client settings, something similar to RuneLite or Alt1. This was tried on a subscription basis with RuneMetrics - but I don't personally think that offers enough value for many people. (Also, frankly, the RuneMetrics website is very slow. The fact this was never addressed is disappointing.)

And I guess more physical merch might be another possible option. The mousemats are very lackluster. Where are the big bright iconic bosses of modern PvM era? AoD? Rasial? Gate of Elidinis? Kerapac? Honestly looking at the existing store, it shouts ""overstuffed junk"" rather than ""Cool premium merch"".

On that note, there are no cuddly toys?! Imagine getting to buy your favourite boss or boss pet as a plushie. Do some polls, find people's favourite cute monsters and market them on streams as background items. :P (I for sure want a cuddly Nex. And maybe a kbd..)",2025-07-01 12:20:00,1

It would be a terrible idea to give into to an idea being fueled from their end. They abandoned the main game and many don't believe for a second they would actually come back to RS3 and stay put for any lenghty period of time. Polls done on this subject should be done in a way that allows to track recent or total playtime put into each game. RS3 players will know the game better than those that haven't played in years and know what would be healtier for the game overall. 

Fresh start worlds are a great thought in the short term, but they would shatter the already small playerbase at the moment, likely in a way that could not be come back from. There is also a huge worry that new players would be directed towards the fresh start worlds as a way to bolster the worlds and give newer players a ""competing"" chance. Fresh start worlds COULD work, but only if the RS3 community saw a sizeable growth before it happened.

Prestige is a controversial topic. It'd be really interesting to completely disable MTX and XP boosters for prestige along with a separate leaderboard. This would, as you mentioned, highly incentivize burning skilling resources. Unfortunately, the reason it is controversial is because it comes with the pitch to include some sort or reward (cosmetic or otherwise), and they don't want to add incentive to 200m, much less doing it multiple times.

Temporary game modes like FSW and Leagues are also good ways to introduce level playing field competition on a regular basis.

The players that invest their time into MTX-free fresh start worlds are not likely to be long-term players like you or me. We're most likely going to keep playing our current accounts and play on the regular servers. The target audience would be new and returning players who wouldn't otherwise be playing RS3 due to the presence and effect of MTX on the game; Effects that, to be clear, will persist in the current game long beyond any change or removal of the current MTX systems. Most of these players won't come back just because Jagex shifts around their MTX system or even removes it completely, the game environment has already been ravaged beyond the point of appeal.

So to me it seems like there's two options. 1.) They overhaul MTX with little prospective gain in players in the short-to-long-term, which is likely unsustainable and will result in either the inevitable reintroduction of excessive MTX or ultimately EoS for the game, or 2.) They offer a game experience fully sanitized of MTX to potentially bring in a substantial new consumer base who wouldn't otherwise touch the game, enabling reduced/removed MTX as a sustainable business model.

I genuinely don't see an option where they reduce/remove MTX and magically bring in players as a result. So to me, you're effectively saying ""I'd rather this game die with me than succeed without me."" I'd rather the game succeed even if my personal account ends up locked to a less popular server/game mode, personally. Though I think there's a potential middle ground to both bring in new players and avoid long-term alienation of veteran accounts; Long-term fresh start worlds that will *eventually* merge into the main game after a number of *years*.

Capture the hype of a sanitized game version for 2/3/4/5 years, complete with a fresh hiscores for the duration, and eventually merge those accounts onto the 'main' servers once enough time has passed and the effects of rampant MTX have faded. Let them retain the historical fresh start hiscores after the merge, maybe even give them a chat badge to delineate them post-merge, but ultimately reunify the game population once the game has succeeded in its recovery period.

That's the only potential path to long-term success that I can see for RS3.",2025-07-02 02:33:16,3

Personally....  
I can get bonus xp, but it kind of ... runs out, and I don't really pay it much attention past that. I have a bunch in skills I am working on getting to 70-80 atm, but honestly if I didn't have it, I wouldn't care... that's me on that though.

As far as not using protean/dummies during dxp, I think people are just going to save items until the next dxp that does allow it... if they do... because it's a waste to do so now.  
Again though, doesn't bother me, they can rot in the bank until dxp, and if that's the last of them, so be it, less bank space used imo.

Now... buying cosmetics... I like this, because getting cosmetics from TH is a pain... you prob spend 100$ in keys (i haven't done this) to get one cosmetic and everyone knows people are aiming for the big ticket 1-2B item...just to sell... when they prob could have just bought bonds and bought the money that way... maybe someone wants the cosmetic, idk.  
I think selling cosmetics in different sale days would be the best idea... past cosmetics need to pop up and things that were removed from the game really need to be in a cosmetic shop... drive some of the crazy cosmetic prices down for things like basic capes that have 0 stat bonuses....

Overall the hit will be minimal, but I like that they're doing experiments instead of straight up dropping an update and not saying anything to the players.

It's not rocket science....There's a few different players and outcomes, so I imagine they're testing one at a time. Granted the dxp thing is gonna flop pretty hard, the people who bought keys for proteans or bonus xp or lamps will prob still buy the bonus xp... but the players who don't aren't going to simply buy bonus xp if it's not boosted as well (2x bonus xp during dxp?)

I also am curious to see the results... hopefully they share that with us like they generally do... Now if only capes and random cosmetics like walks didn't suddenly cost 100m or a billion....",2025-07-02 17:49:21,3

If Jagex is doing this for the current player base then they're severely missing the mark and nothing will change. Anyone who has quit within the last 5 years because of MTX isn't going to magically return even if it goes away, and new players certainly aren't going to come try a game out that's been riddled with MTX for decades and has had it built into the very foundation of the game.

OS players want a reason to try Rs3 with no mtx but trust me we aren't begging for a seasonal RS3 leagues style game mode when OSRS is killing it on that front. We don't ***need*** Rs3, we'd just really like to return to a game that clearly has good bossing, QOL, and unique graphics but not at the cost of competing with 20+ year old accounts with 100b+ banks, years of bought progression through MTX, and cosmetics that are seasonal rares I assure you.",2025-07-02 02:41:05,0

If someone quit because of MTX, why would they not return now that it’s gone? 

Why would new players care if MTX once existed in the past 25 years? We have posts of new players here all the time enjoying their journey. If you started WOW today or any other MMO or mobile game are you going to demand everyone start fresh because now you’ve arrived? 

Exactly. OS players don’t need RS3. RS3 doesn’t need OSRS players. We need NEW players. If you want to play RS3 without MTX Ironman already exists. Go play if you’d like. It’s funny how all the OS players are acting like fresh start is the only way just so they can try it out. Then they leave in a week when they realize they actually left because of EOC. Then you have fresh world with very few NEW players and the OG server that’s abandoned the vets. 

Removing MTX has NOTHING to do with OSRS players. It’s not about brining them back. It’s not about OS players getting to try an MTX free world for a week before quitting again. It’s about getting new players to join RS3 and grow the game.

The new player experience is terrible, the game isn't consistent, and the overly obnoxious cosmetics make for a horrible experience. All this coupled with the fact that MTX is plaguing the game and you're hard pressed to get any new players that stick around.

When was the last time you made a new account and leveled it to mid/end game? You know what's funny?

The former is a safer guess as it would fit in with what the previous two skills offered, with invention giving perks and archaeology giving relic power, making it a proven formula for adding new skills.

The second guess is a bit more daring, but the payoff could be huge. Adding a fourth combat style would mean a fresh set of combat abilities to give PVM more variety, plus opening a huge amount of reward space for all the gear that it would use.  
Of course there's the question of if it would be distinct enough from magic thematically for it to stand out, and it would need to immediately start out with comparable gear to the other styles to compete, so this is far from a confident guess, just an interesting possibility.

- This feels like it overlaps with a *lot* of skills: Summoning, Magic, Prayer, Divination, possibly even Archaeology.

- Is this a combat skill, skilling, or a mix of both? Where will it fit with Summoning and Magic?

- Are they going to rework historical quests that involved necromancy conceptually but put it under skills like Magic and Prayer?

- How will this affect equipment metas if it is indeed a combat skill?

Necromancy,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/zl2ctv/new_skill_confirmed_on_stream_its_necromancy/,zl2ctv,j03jxwj,WittyUnwittingly,"Ok ok, hear me out: Necromancy should involve using mass resurrection mechanics to complete tasks involving *other skills.*

You start with some mechanically easy but insurmountable task, like ""cut 3000 of these trees."" Sure, you *could* go do it by hand, but the 10k necromancy XP you'd get for completing a single task would make this about as feasible as mass disassembling for Invention xp.

Instead, maybe you need to go kill a few goblins or whatever to get started, but then *you resurrect them* to go cut logs for you. As you get higher levels with more complex tasks, you'll unlock minions that can do more killing and more resurrecting on their own. And so, completion of the task is this sort of management dance not terribly unlike an RTS.

Give us meaningful rewards that provide us with advantages to other skills like the chance to proc a temporary NPC ""helper"" while skilling (for increased resource gathering or faster crafting). Give range and melee unlockable Animate Dead equivalents (lore wise, this makes sense). Make Necromancy the chief ""support"" skill, so that it's *directly beneficial* to other skills to level Necromancy.

I think this would be cool because this is sort of the way necromancers work in most literature. Sure, the necromancer themself is a formidable foe, but the real threat comes from the ""armies of undead"" that they *command*, and they're usually less of the ""one man army"" type and more often tacticians.",2022-12-13 20:42:29,2

 The only thing that concerns me is what is going to keep Summoning relevant after Necromancy? Unless Necromancy is tied in with Summoning when it comes to familiars but these familiars will end up evolving like Pokémon.

If I had to do a guess I would say they are going to make this more dark science and less ""magical.""
It may be an elite skill but for the sake of discussion lets say it's not. 
I think the core loop will revolve around players acquiring materials for the skill either through bones (since they're already drops) or from locations like graveyards similar in how we do in Archaeology. We go get the thing, then we bring the thing to a science doo-dad, where we refine it into something useful (and also spooky and evil of course) and then this useful thing will likely augment combat somehow. 
We have no clue what the specifics are but I think if we look at their design track record of wanting new stuff to ""feel like runescape"", then what we should assume is that the previous game design concepts that were well received, will be reimplemented in this new skill.",2022-12-13 18:40:21,-2

I think instead of being an elite skill, it will tie in significantly with a few skills.  
Summoning will tie in with the aspect of Necromancy that involves bringing forth the dead. I imagine a say zombie summon ability would require you to have a summoning requirement and to create a stack of zombie ""ammo"" using summoning.  
I also see Archelogy being involved since we already have a trapped soul in our bank and I can imagine having a number of ancient souls you can discover through Archeology that might allow you to unlock combat abilities that supplement your minions by tapping into these souls. Similarly, I can see slayer or bossing being an extra avenue to trap new souls by defeating creatures for drops to unlock more abilities.

Entirely different combat class that has abilities focused on the idea of necromancy. It would be a really cool experience running around casting all these AoE / DoT abilities + up-keeping a ton of buffs that would constantly benefit you as a necro. Perfect class to very easily become a meta for DPS, Tank, or even dedicated Healer. All 3 at once, honestly. But that’s putting way too much faith into Jagex :/",2022-12-13 23:25:37,1

 Could see it being a Crafting Into Gathering skill, creating peons who gather and perform labor, akin to miscellania but with more detail? 
 
Also possible, something that feeds back and forth with Slayer, killing monsters to get parts to make WEIRDER monsters to get cool stuff and exp, etc? The Tower of Life and the Necromancers Tower are right next to each other, and could use a revamp... 
       It would probably take way too much work, but I'd love a modular ""build a creature"" system. Protector skeleton with six arms with sharpened forearms, a ribcage tire/coffin toting creature of burden with a dozen legs, a single skeletal hand with sassy talking skull to herald ones arrival... (Necromancy Skill Pet please 👀)

I wouldn't be surprised if there was a Prayer aspect, considering, or some link between them... Communicating with and helping the undead find rest? (Surprised we don't have a minigame like that in the vein of a crafting sense. I miss my old sapphire necklace... etc,) But Runescape DOES enjoy a bit of dubious morality, so I'd love to have more sinister methods as well.

I believe they said itd be fairly accessible, so I doubt it would be an Elite Skill, at least on par with Invention...

I can see several Necromancers being somewhat more relevant again. Maybe going after Tarn for his book for it as well, Magilnius Mortifer maybe being the beginners teacher for it, haha! I imagine several graveyards will end up with some kind of crypt for us to use? (Wouldn't it be funny if they just ported all of Kourend??)

* short time undead minion raising, where something pops up and does a single action or lasts for a few seconds
* Longer time minions that continually attack, buff, or debuff
* Abilities that buff minions or order them to take certain actions like make a more powerful attack or self destruct. Also a button to assign minions a target that works off-GCD like with familiars
* More magic-like combat abilities like damage with thematic health draining, debuffs, and buffs.
  
 It would probably be neutral on the combat triangle with undead minions having an assigned style (one of the 4). Minions could aggro monsters, even bosses, allowing them to be kept off your back for some time with careful ability rotations. Compared to the other styles, abilities might have a stronger focus on cool stuff like health draining, temporarily increasing your max health, decreasing enemy damage, damage interception by minions, or self-damaging effects, along with just having extra minions on the battlefield. It could even have options to become a ""support"" combat style with multiple ally healing/buffing abilities.  
  
What I do wonder, though, is how they would provide enough equipment for an entire new style in one drop. This could require dozens of new armor and weapon sets to be introduced on release, but where would they come from? Or, could we somehow use existing melee/ranged/magic gear as our necromancy gear, perhaps via a one-way conversion process? Or would all hybrid gear be changed into hybrid/necromancy gear?

Summoning already exists.  Necromancy is raising souls from the dead.  Summoning is... raising souls from pouches?  The point is that necromancy can absolutely be an expansion on summoning.  Ironmen have to kill creatures for drops to make summoning pouches for very similar creatures, that's essentially necromancy right there.

I wasn't even against the OSRS purposed skill of warding, which seemed quite a bit like an expansion on crafting, but proposed to function very differently, significantly more like invention in RS3.  It made sense to me because it was a processing skill that didn't exactly tread on other processing skills.  But without more information on how necromancy will function, this just seems like it would be the kind of skill that makes summoning obsolete, or it will be DoA.

Asking players to go wade through hours of useless content and unlocks until you hit 80 where if it'll be useful in something unrelated, is a bit frustrating.

This is partially because their realm lacks runestones, so they draw magical power from souls and from the Rift instead. If that sounds kind of vague, it is! It's because we still don't know much about Teragard yet :P

The Magister is from Teragard and is a particularly skilled user of soul magic, using it to store his soul in a phylactery to revive himself, as well as draining the player when you fight him. Notably, the Magister is called a necromancer by the wiki. Also, in Succession >!Bilrach raids the Library of Menaphos looking for information on Teragardian soul magic, in order to use it to build his ""suck the soul out of every human on Gielinor"" stone.!<

Teragard being referenced in the new quest as well as the ""possible future"" section of Once Upon a Time makes me think we might be getting a narrative focus on Teragard soon.

I'm only judging the thematic consistency of it fitting amongst the ranks of the other skills.

How would you feel if the new skill was called Pyromancy. Don't we already have magic? Would you also say ""we don't know anything about pyromancy""? Of course we know about what it is. Same with Necromancy.

I've used divination as an example who's training method might as well have been jibberish and doesn't tie into any high or low fantasies of any form of media ever. Making it the most unrelatable skill.

My point is if they make a sensible and relatable training method, it will likely feel too similar to already existing skills.

Like habbo hotel or club penguin or the Sims or animal crossing and a billion others. It could be it's own playstyle. Where people just mess with player owned houses stuff. 

It's a huge potential revenue stream and would drive so many players to the game. You used to have people on this game just to hangout and talk, like my girlfriend used to. That demographic is long gone. This could bring it back.

But this wouldn’t make sense as a separate skill, it would make a lot more sense to just add it as an unlock to invention where you can combine weapons and just have high requirements to make and use the weapons (I guess similar to eof but for weapons).

Even clan Castles would be neat if it had a variety of customizable things to make the castles really unique but required players to build together.

I went back and re-watched it and the closest thing I found was the following quote from 1:43:42 on the Twitch replay. At this point they are talking about the narrative around Zamorak and how next year they want to bring the focus back around to a player centric narrative and be a little less over the top. 

Mod Hooli Q: Is the new skill within this narrative, is it its own thing, or is it a bit of both? 

Mod Jack A: ...one of the key things about the new skill is that we don't want to gate that behind other content. It doesn't make sense; imagine if you had to do something like the puzzle box to unlock the new skill, that would be crazy.... so the story line will not lock the skill and the way we have resolved that narratively is that the skill kind of starts in its own place but then it will later merge with the story line. It will make more sense to talk about that more next year when we know more about what the new skill actually is. 

After talking about the new skill and how it will tie into next years narrative they then move to Mod Asherz who talks about Fort Forinthry and the vision for it being a laid back not overly involved construction method. I could not find any mention of the fort construction being tied to Necromancy anywhere else. 

While I think it would be fair to expect the fort, which the storyline is centered around, to play a narrative role in the new skill. Claiming that construction will be a key to the new skill and that the devs said as much is a significant leap.

Why disassemble vs siphon: disassemble gives components but destroys the item, siphoning allows you to keep the item and still gain the xp, just with less invention xp per item xp. Why is that important? Siphoning allows you to still gain invention xp while allowing you to use endgame equipment, rather than just disassembling t70/t80 equipment which would be far more expensive to maintain. (it can still be worth levelling up that equipment and disassembling for the components though)

>What does a dissolver do vs a siphon vs a separator vs a regular dismantle and oh wait I can just dismantle with the inventory interface I don't need an item for that, but for the other things I need an item. I get XP for dismantling but I get more at higher levels with 10 being the best unless I use a siphon then I don't destroy the item but I need to level it up to 12 instead but..
>

A dissolver allows you do deaugment an item to sell if it's an augmentation dissolver, or reperk your items if it's a gizmo dissolver. A seperator allows you to seperate an expensive perk from an expensive weapon of piece of armor without destroying the perk or armor, which a gizmo dissolver or augmentation dissolver would not do. 

Why are they seperate items? Because they're rewards for having higher invention levels, disassembling is the core. Think of the inventory thing like a chisel on your toolbelt. Everything else is just a 1 time use thing you make with components. 

I've never experienced fishing not giving me experience on my rod-o-matic.

Why aren't some items augmentable? Well it's supposed to be an item sink, so items that really don't need to be sunk, or don't have much use shouldn't really be augmentable. I will say I think purple flowers being the only augmentable flower is a little goofy, but I think it being augmentable is more a qol thing so you can bladed dive without raising your death cost. 

The thing I really appreciate about invention is how open it is, and that it literally promotes doing everything in the game, it gave me a reason to train firemaking, fishing, woodcutting, mining and smithing. It gives divination a purpose since energy is what powers all of your equipment. It also makes low level training methods and monsters lucrative since so many things give vital components. 

I guess it could be a little more hand holdy, but the materials list tells you what perks the components you have give and how to obtain them. It's also fast to train, and not a grind. It's literally the exact opposite thing to archeology.

Corruption that could only occur from shadow anima since it harmed the elder gods massively.

To assert that shadow magic and shadow anima are completely different from that statement would be... short sighted. It is not saying they are entirely separate. I see it as more... filtered. Diluted. several exponential levels less strong than shadow anima. Logically, and lore wise, this would make sense. Barely anything in Gelinor can actual wield shadow anima. If they could wield it, that would make them immensely strong. Gods couldn't even wield it, save for Zaros who was born from it.

Prior to release Jagex did say that 120 necro would be comparable to 99 in other combat skills, and that Necromancy would be releasing “undertuned”. I think it’s very clear both of these things didn’t happen. On one hand, I very much enjoy the level of power that Necromancy gives me, on the other hand I am very concerned about the amount of power Necromancy gives me because it completely devalues my previous gear. I had full max mage(fsoa praesuls etect etc all BIS perks) and close to max range, and I’ve destroyed the PRs I set with those styles using Necromancy. I don’t inherently have a problem with becoming stronger, however it is going to completely invalidate old content if the other combat styles aren’t brought up to par very quickly. We can already see huge crashing of prices for things like FSOA, BOLG, Lengs, etc when comparing to the t95 Necro set, but an even greater concern to me is how stupid strong the base T90 set is. The base T90 necro set completely blows all T90 and T92 gear from other combat styles out of the water, all the while being significantly easier to obtain than the other weapons which is going to render a LOT of boss content in the game irrelevant outside of boss log hunters.

As somebody who doesn't have slot of free time, I've had to buy most of my gear. It takes BILLIONS of gold to get t92 items, ability books, unlocks and more to be bound to ONE style.

Necromancy by contrast is virtually free so long as you have patience and are willing to kill bosses. It's a great way to get people interested in other bosses as well and give them a foothold to build from.

Do most people know how hard it is to take that leap from 70 to 80 gear and the dozens/hundreds of hours grinding bosses or gold to upgrade? Only to learn you're doing it AGAIN 3 to 4 more times on even longer time scales? It's needless grind that scares off most players that would make great additions to the pvm community.

I can pick up FF14, WoW, or a handful of other games and start working on endgame gear with MUCH less time involvement than runescape.

Might be a based take, but if we want Runescape to survive the next 10 years we NEED a class that can do what necromancy does. The other 3 can remain as they are if necessary.",2023-08-28 16:18:20,25

You shouldn’t expect to put out damage comparable to someone who has mastered the game. If you aren’t willing to learn mechanics or some semblance of a rotation you can always pick flax for gp instead of bossing. 

The release has destroyed the economy, devalued most of the drops in the game, and made AOD, rasial and telos the only bosses worth doing to make money. It has undermined the most valuable resource of all committed players-time. 

Similar to nerfing fsoa two years too late, any player who saved up for months, or years, to afford a bolg or fsoa have had their net worth crippled by necromancy. Anyone who thinks necromancy isn’t broken needs a sub to lumosity because you can’t memorize a 10 button order. Sadly the damage is already done and we are seeing the biggest collapse of the economy in the history of the game. Necromancy release got a lot of things right (I love the sense of community at the ritual sites, the thoughtfulness of necromancy abilities like building souls and necrosis stacks, etc), but it was incredibly short-sighted to introduce a near-afk boss in rasial that drops t95. Letting players craft t80 or 85 armor instead of t90 and having rasial to drop t90 potentially would have made it less of a joke. The necromancy kit itself already strikes the balance  of allowing low-effort players access to higher level content then they have business attempting (an ability
that lets you dodge 20% of hits, a self-healing minion, a minion that does damage for you, an auto ability you don’t need to hit a key to use, 5 stuns at telos, the list goes on).",2023-08-28 17:17:49,8

One immediate effect I'm seeing is at greg. Caroming 4 is no longer relevant so his drops are now worth less than 10m. If jagex isn't able to bring the other three into line, whole swaths of content will become pretty irrelevant.

You can see this pronounced effect with magister after gwd3 release. New melee weps bis and the value of doing magister became near worthless. The only thing keeping him afloat now is the nerf to vital sparks drop rates.

I think TheRSGuy described it well: for the ither styles you have to play through a decade of content with all these small incremental updates before you get to the endgame (weapons, abilities, codexes, books, switches, perks, EOFs, etc.) While necromancy allows you to ""catch up"" within one solid skill release. With no reliance on auras, scrimshaws and incense sticks: it's just RS3 combat without the need for all the excess sweaty mechanics, while still being able to use those mechanics to go even further. Max necro with t95 gear should be roughly as powerful as max other styles with t95 gear. The fact that the skill is a month old shouldn't matter.

I am not that big into PvM because I already have trouble multitasking movement, HP, prayers, potions and boss mechanics. It's just easily overwhelming for me, and whole it works to just practice, the way of practicing where you die and try again does not work for everyone and is psychologically more likely to turn people away from bossing than to perservere and learn. Having people get kills, notice where they're taking big damage and adapt to those things, get faster kills, get cleaner kills, use less resources: that is rewarding in a way that's not so punishing. The death cost rework helped, but this just bridges the gap between low and high tier PvM nicely!

A TheRSGuy quote that fits nicely with this: ""Do you know how much bossing in this game sucks?  When you grind a boss for 20 hours to get 1/3rd of a weapon? (...)

I’ve been playing since late 2004, but on and off for the past 10 years or so, being an adult with a job and priorities in life other than sweating out the newest meta. While I agree that many players don’t have the time to invest into getting proficient at top tier PVM, you don’t need to kill high enrage zamorak to dip your feet into PVM. There are plenty of low-mid tier bosses that are accessible to every player with base 80 stats and t80 gear that anybody at those levels can afford. KBD, GWD1 and 2, KQ, etc, were all high tier bosses at one point, accessible only to the most skilled and best equipped players. Back in 2010 I was still struggling to get more than a couple of Kree kills per trip, now it’s an afk boss that requires no input. I play casually, a few hours a week, and I’m completely ok with the fact that I can’t even touch some of the highest tier bosses. 

Necro isn’t a crutch that allows people to get into PVM, it’s a crutch that allows people to get into high tier PVM that was previously only accessible to the top level players. Eventually, they’ll release more powerful bosses that will require much more input, skill, and equipment to complete, and that’s totally fine. A game needs to have challenging content that only the most skilled players can complete.

This was also pre-death rework so deaths were costly. 

Now I'm learning again, and was able to pick it up very quickly with Necromancy. The simplicity of the rotation makes doing a good ultimate rotation much more accessible, and I'm able to keep track of mechanics much easier. The extra life from tank Armour (just chest and legs for me) makes the big hit mechanics more forgiving, and I'm starting to streak. 

Give me some more time, and I'll go back and try with Mage again, taking the mechanics knowledge I'll have gained and I'll probably do better than with Necro. But the biggest part of Necro isn't isn't damage output, but the ease of its rotation to execute at a decent level.

I love the fact that its good and accessible, i hate the fact that its competitive at the high end with a quarter of the effort, that is the problem, it kills all incentive to improve and makes progress people have made devalued.

I would sweat if i wanted a fast raksha time, pool skipping was out of the question for me, now i could very easily do it if i wanted.

The skill literally takes all the benefits that the other styles had and does it better than all of them.

Mage tankyness, necromancy does it better
Melles quick burst, necromancy does it better
Ranges consistent dps, necromany does it better
Mage and ranges aoe room clear, necromancy does it better
Mage extended burst, necromancy does it better

Necromancr is also the most easiest to gear up compared to other classes. I don't see how making necromancer harder to gear will benefit anyone outside of gatekeepers who's salty. I think this is purely a itemization problem that Jagex should consider reworking. But that's just me.

If anything, the three combat style should be the standard Necromancer is setting. If you want to nerf the damage, I don't think anyone is going to disagree.

First: it has fewer abilities. Less, in this case, is more. Simpler to learn, fewer things to manage, and fewer things to balance.


Melee, range and mage have too many abilities. Some of them are god damn clones (the basic stun abilities and the shock/horror varients), and some are 2h vs 1h exclusive. Like, do we truly need so many? To a new player, this must be absolutely overwhelming.

Necromancy, on the other hand, just just abilities for one style. No 2h, no shield. While the greater bone shield can make things OP, it also currently costs you 4 inventory slots, but makes gear switching a thing of the past.

What I hate about RS's combat, even in OSRS, is gear swapping within the same style. Swapping a weapon is fine, but having to juggle 2 sets of gear for a single boss is just annoying. 

Is gear switching optimal? Yes. But at what cost? All the fun is taken out for pure panic and stress of making sure you get all the clicks in properly.


Also, all the horrible interactions that are left in the game. 4taa with magic, and all the various bugs that became accepted (prayer flicking, etc) that high level pcm basically requires you to master. Need an EOF? How about 4 for all the various specials you've stored up! And good luck remembering the colors!!!!

The fact necromancy lacks this is amazing. Yeah rasiel requires us to learn to attack while walking, which is somewhat hanky without practice, but this isn't nearly on the level of gear switching.

I used to play Maplestory (as short lived as that was, also fuck Nexon) and the game had a concise infographic before you choose your class to play. It shows you the ease of use/difficulty you can expect playing that chosen class. I think all games should offer something like this so players know what they are getting themselves into. 

Like if a newer player starts RuneScape and they want to just melee stuff - they need to level 3 seperate skills, mainhands/offhands, havoc robes/cfmw, abyssal armor spikes, two EoFs for EZK/Dragon Claws or D2H, greater barge, chaos roar, etc. For Necromancy, you just level Necromancy. It's so simple. I love that about it. If you want the armor and runes you might need to do some skilling, but the armor is very verrry available (and cheap iirc from another post).

Although, the combat style has me personally floored atm. I can't wait to see how it flourishes.

It requires less effort and can do similar damage than the other styles. For example, if I wanted to hit 4 things with greater chain I have to use a caroming switch, unlock greater chain, use a strong spell, then follow it up with abilities that synergize well with it for only 50% of the damage to translate to my secondary target. With necromancy? You just threads go brr. 100% of your potential damage is spread and no switches or difficult unlocks required.

I've also seen most my friends (who are ""bad"" pvmers)  break their PR's at their favorite bosses by MASSIVE margins and not even using half the necro abilities. Its just use death skulls and sometimes when you have lil soul bois you toss em. I think if you took skilled or noob players and gave them both t90 magic and t90 necro, they'll just do more damage with necro period. The commands require zero skill and do TRUCKLOADS of damage and you can even command the skele for no adren cost. You take into the equation the t95 gear BOOSTS your summons damage and you have something that takes no skill, can be used at any adren, and htis 10-20k damage with a short CD.

Rasial is the highest money per hour by an absolute country mile. Much harder bosses are just being ignored, bar a couple of exeptions because they feed into necro - ie AOD. 

It's not about new players being able to pvm - that is great. It's that necro completely overtakes the current best pvm setups by at least 20%. Why would anyone ever play another style?

Not even bringing mage and ranged into it, since they're both with an upfront cost for the skills alone that you need to buy.

With that being said up until now Ive been pretty casual player kinda joining in small periods of time. Ranged was my main style and I dumped EVERYTHING into it. I had 0 gear invested into mage or melee but 15b++ into range (like grico, eofs etc when it was still very expensive).
My main money maker was raksha. Ive done about 1200 kc there using ranged with all those investments into it.

It took me less than 5 tries to beat every ranged pb I've had with necro. To me, that just feels like to much. The necro investment is a fraction of what I had done for ranged, both in time and money, but now ranged feels completely useless.

Cons:

1) Way more resources to pay attention to, so I generally don't *learn new bosses* with necro very cleanly. Lots of dying due to a necro thing distracting me from the boss's 1 shot.

With that being said up until now Ive been pretty casual player kinda joining in small periods of time. Ranged was my main style and I dumped EVERYTHING into it. I had 0 gear invested into mage or melee but 15b++ into range (like grico, eofs etc when it was still very expensive).
My main money maker was raksha. Ive done about 1200 kc there using ranged with all those investments into it.

It took me less than 5 tries to beat every ranged pb I've had with necro. To me, that just feels like to much. The necro investment is a fraction of what I had done for ranged, both in time and money, but now ranged feels completely useless. 

Again, I don't mind necro being more accessible, make pvm more consistent/less bothersome and get new players into it. But I do feel like a limit should exist somewhere, similiar to a weakness system. It shouldnt be blindly BIS *everywhere* which it does seem to be right now. Especially when I need to have sweat dripping from my forehead to get even close to my necro times with ranged.

I just more so hope the other styles get adressed in some way soon thats all. I enjoy things being easier and less effort in terms of switchscape and all of that please do not misunderstand.

I need 100x the time or money to reach the same result, if I used ranged because it feels better I won't get teams because I'm being inefficient.

Jagex isn't exactly known for swift updates. They aren't even known for completing updates at that.

How long will I have to wait until combat feels good again for me? 1 year? 2 years? 3? How much will I fall behind if I choose to not use the only meta combat style?

Necromancy is certainly overpowered relative to the other styles. I think you have to objectively understand that reality first. But that doesn't mean that necromancynis overpowered for runescape. 

The three original combat styles have all failed to feel cohesive since eoc dropped, largely because of the split design between 2h and dual wield. The disconnect there has elevated ""what's possible"" while creating a pretty inaccessible barrier to entry. Boss design has been made around this ceiling and somethings have been rough. 

Part of the reason, I think, that Necromancy as we have it right now is so strong is that it's been cohesively designed as one thing, as opposed to a bunch of hodge podge abilities that they've tried to mash together that somewhat follow the same formula between the 3 original styles. We don't have a bunch of skills that are underpowered because they're designed to do something that rarely has relevance (stun skills lol). Necromancy is a pretty clear holistic experience compared to the other three styles.

Additionally, I think it's pretty easy to see that Necromancy is now meant to be the benchmark for where combat skills are going in the future. I would not be surprised to see the other 3 combat skills revamped to be more like necromancynin combat when they get boosted to 120. I also think that the ease of rasial and the onboarding of t95 Necromancy gear is a clear indication that t95 is meant to be the new baseline and is just meant to get everyone up to that baseline in a simple manner for when they start to push caps further.

The fact you need so much to achieve that with magic is a problem with magic not with necromancy. Necromancy’s design makes a hell of a lot more sense. You have an action that makes your next blow hit multiple targets, and then you use an attack and it hits multiple targets. That’s sensible game design and very intuitive, it leads to then people to experiment and start to pick up ways this can be used in other combos without a spread sheet of knowledge. It harkens back to design like ancient magic where you have a spell family that specifically is for AoE and all you had to do was complete a quest and get the magic levels.

What’s not sensical? To need multiple abilities and invention perks to achieve the same thing. Basically you are only evidencing how unnecessarily bloated the old combat is.

It takes a while to unlock things and rank skills in RS. I have no doubt about seeing this coming.

For bosses too; everyone will always have an incentive to kill them. You have titles, gizmo parts, Ironmen, drop logs, etc that people will still want. Having access to stronger gear actually allows these bosses to be done for cheaper and for longer periods. This also makes endgame items and gizmo parts more affordable as a whole for people to get into other styles.

If I had just started this game playing necromancy, my reaction would have been; ""Wow, this is fun! I wonder what the other classes are like?"". Then when I went to look up other gear sets on the wiki I would of came to the realization of ""Hey! I killed that for the gear I have now! I'm gonna go back and kill more!"". 

I have no objections with the bosses remaining difficult. As an example, I'm still struggling with Zuk but I wouldn't want him nerfed for my own sense of achievement. However, if I get to 120 necromancy and kill him with that, I'll still feel like I've earned it.

The last part of this is input cost vs. return on investment. To that effect I would say all bosses have some form of luck. Whether or not you use GP per hour metrics and grind based on that, the system already generates winners and losers. Even before Necromancy you could make billions in a few hours, or make dirt over 50 hours. So the item you get is only worth it to you based on your luck essentially.

If we take that metric out and do GP per hour, it should make sense that you mostly make your money on t90+. Even then, a player shouldn't be making so much money that they get an OVERWHELMING profit in just one good drop. Necromancy still allows for this.

Rs3 also suffers from a MASSIVE inflation issue on top of having an entrenched elitist community. We have had a substantial bottleneck on good endgame gear for a long time. At the minimum, we need to raise accessibility to lower tiers of gear to help people get to the 90+ grind, and Necromancy does that well.

People need to start comparing Rs3 to other games in how the endgame is handled. Rs3 is not the same game, but we need to analyze our community size vs. theirs and what has worked for them. If we don't do that, runescape won't be here in 10 years. Having an accessible PVM system is 100% part of winning formulas. Necromancy is a good step in this direction in my opinion. HOWEVER, I will say another combat update is needed that HEAVILY awards the player in DPS for picking one of the combat corners and those gear sets need to drop as they have in the past.

This concludes my rant.",2023-08-28 17:21:15,0

Honestly you're probably right, there's the reputation that pvm requires all of the below before you're allowed to start PVMing ""properly"":

Full manual, Dark Bow EoF, ECB EoF, SGB EoF, Flanking switch, Planted feet switch, Caroming switch, Lunging switch, Shield switch (With turtling 4), The best perks, 4TAA, Berserker's Fury, All of Livid Farm unlocked, Dominion Mines, Elder Overloads, All auras, limitless, Enhanced Excalibur, Ancient Elven Crystal, Ancient summoning (and I'm sure I'm missing some)

Which in reality it doesn't, you need a shield swap some bosses, and that's it, but it's pushed so much that that's what you need to do it properly that people are too scared to try PvM without it and don't want to go for it all.

Many bosses are made such that burst/dps above certain thresholds trivializes them. Take Raksha for example. Every phase resets its special attack order, so if you can deal 200k damage before it can do the phase transition + 4 auto attacks, you've basically created a new dps dummy. The quicker damage goes up, the less relevant bosses you will have at any given time.

It makes more sense to nerf necromancy in line with the other 3 styles simply because there isn't that much of a downside to doing so. It's one of the few times where this is the case, since none of the damage comes from boss drops whose prices are hugely impacted by relevancy of the ability/equipment that they drop.

Sure you can get kills with gano + AD but there's a trade-off. Everyone knows that crypt + AD will get you better times so you want to upgrade so you do croesus. You want better times so you do kerapac to get gconc, heck maybe even go for an fsoa. You get really comfortable with the bosses, you want even better times. Go grind out some ed2 and vorago, make yourself some tectonic gear and rely less on AD. You can see that while gano + AD allowed for a lower floor to access pvm, there's still a much higher ceiling. As it is right now, you don't have anything to strive for aside from rasial. The floor is low and you don't need to even reach the ceiling to have superior results compared to near bis equipment in other styles.

On the one hand, you have players who will join the pvm economy and be buying more drops from more bosses which helps things balance out. On the other hand, you have people who will only buy necro gear once from Rasial, not buy other gear, and then prices for the other gears crash and burn as it's not relevant content. Great you got a grico at raksha, but who's still using ranged?

Do you see what I mean? I don't think it's the same. I think it's awesome that more people are pvming. It's been awesome hearing clannies getting their first kills at rax and telos.

This is such a frequently raised straw man that it should be pinned to the top of the subreddit. 

No one learning a boss is doing any of this, nor are they expected to for low-mid tier PvM (read as Nex duo/GWD2/low enr Rax and under). 

But time and again this ""argument"" that switches are somehow preventing people from learning Nex tier content comes up because it's convenient and shifts the onus from the player to the system. Moreover, this is while Jagex is actively making attempts to reduce switchscape (Sun/DS codices, permanent Vigour, Dive not needing DW melee, etc.) which just makes the stance appear even more disingenuous. 

Are there flaws with the system? Yes. 

Does Necromancy address many of those flaws? Yes (namely the clear integration of autos to form a basic rotation, reduction in switching, etc.).

Does Necromancy have flaws of its own?
Yes. If people at all levels of PvM ability are casually breaking their own records (which they've likely had for months) at content with little more than T80/T90 gear and a few weeks of understanding, the numbers are *probably* overtuned.

For range, you dont have to switch at all unless you want to do an incend rot in which you switch a single time to wcb. You also have 2 eofs to juggle but eof swaps are far less time sensitive.

It really doesn't understand the type of game an MMO is in terms of design, balance and progression, and puts too much stress on limiting the caps and potentials of new things so as not to overshadow old stuff.

The assumption it makes is that nothing is going to change regarding the other three styles. Runescape is a live service game that is constantly seeing updates and adjustments. It is also, as all MMOs are, a ""numbers go up"" game. one of the key aspects of a live service ""numbers go up"" game is that every once and a while you need to create a catch up mechanic. when you make a new leap forward in progression, content, or design, you make leap-frogging old content easier and reaching the new baseline faster and more accessible. The reason you do this is to reduce the slog of getting through progression because that same slog inhibits player retention. the longer a new player feels they have to go to reach the endgame, the lower retention gets. once you've made that leap frogging reality, then you find other ways to make the old content relevant. you give players reasons to go back and do something rather than just letting it collect dust.

Necromancy *being* there makes the game less fun to me. I can't choose not to use it. Why would I camp kril with my lunars and vanquish when I have t90 necromancy? Why would I camp vindy with elder rune when I have t90 necromancy? 

""The option is there for you to intentionally gimp yourself"" is only a valid argument when it's officially supported. Relying on people to do that on their own is a ridiculous stance.

And you do have the option to not pay billion of gold or engaging in mechanics you find undesirable for better gear! gwd1 armour is inexpensive and good enough for all content in the game, and some t90 weapons of your choice are a couple hundred mil. You don't need a fsoa, you don't need trimmed masterwork. You don't need arch glacor weapons. You don't need a bolg. You don't have to switch, ever. You don't have to be full manual, ever.

Do you need to hit freedom sometimes? Sure. Do you have to reso sometimes? Yea. Do you have to barricade on occasion? Definitely. 


But come on. Get over yourself. If you don't enjoy *basic* shit, runescape's not for you. End of story. You wanna go play your ff14 and never hit your abilities manually then be my guest, but you'll probably be kicked from parties because ff14 doesn't even have a revo equivalent lmao.

Essentially for each rare roll you do, you build up a greater and greater chance of receiving a rare item when you do not pull one.

With this toggle on, when you successfully roll a rare drop specific to that boss, the drop mechanics will default to giving you the next missing item on your log moving left to right with the pet being last. You cannot choose the item, it is only available ""in order"".

With this toggle off, the drop mechanics will default to attempting to give you any rare specific to that boss, even if it's a duplicate.

In both circumstances, as soon as you recieve your drops, that's it. The pity value resets.

Necromancy comes out. I plug away at it for a week and reach 99. I decide to finally upgrade from the T70 sets and go all the way to T90 to kill Rasial. Okay, easy enough to do with this style. This style is a lot of fun and I'm enjoying the first week with it. It feels powerful and mixing Revo and Manual is extremely comfy in every fight, plus the convenience of Bone Shield is very satisfying. With T90 done, it's time to get the T95 stuff. Learning the kills and optimizing them ends with me around 950 kc, where I finally get the robe top and am done with the boss for now. 

Awesome, that means I have full T95 on a combat style that is usable in 99% of places in the game, so I can go farm anything I want. So what do I actually want to farm? Fsoa is the first thing that comes to mind, but I have to stop and think... where am I going to use fsoa if I have a set of T95 and weapon that blows magic away at every turn? So why would I do Kerapac? Even if i dont have gconc, there's no point. And if I'm not getting fsoa, there's no way in hell I'm getting bolg or sgb. No content in the game at the high end matters except the Necromancy gear because it's the most powerful gear and style right now. All the other boss drops prices will tank because there will be no one at Helwyr for T85 weapons when you could just do 5 kills of each GWD2 boss for full T90. The progression curve will just become quest requirements and 68 Archaeology and 85 Invention instead of feeling like you're gradually getting stronger until you can kill a boss who was previously a wall to you.

The point is not the strength of Necromancy, the point is not the accessibility of Necromancy. The point is that it completely overturns account combat progression and actively renders bosses as recent as GWD3 dead content. Even if the other styles get bumped to 120, Necromancy will still be your strongest style to farm the new tiers of the other styles, so everything before new T95 gear, every boss farmed for upgrades in the past 16 years is just dead content.",2023-08-29 02:26:34,1

Yes you CAN choose to not use Necromancy. It's called not equipping the weapons. The game is NOT balanced around necromancy right now. It's balanced around the 3 original combat styles. Your personal gameplay is not affected, only your group gameplay is.

No, I disagree with intentionally limiting yourself not mattering if it's not officially supported. Why do pures exist when pk is virtually gone now? Why do people do youtube challenges like ""Leveling only in the wilderness"" when they can go literally anywhere to get exp? Simple. Self imposed challenge. If you REQUIRE an officially supported challenge mode to perform it, that is a lack of self control issue, not a lack of latent ability / decision making ability.

You're right that I DONT have to be full manual ever, but if I want to do everything at peak efficiency and/or the hardest bosses in game its needed. I'm sure there is some sweat god out there that can do HM Zuk in T75 gear, but that isn't me. They also wouldn't get the fastest kills times even if they did. Which unfortunately, kill times matter if you want to make long term money in this game utilizing the GE. This doesn't apply to Ironmen, but that doesn't describe me here.

In regards to FF14, the game is built around fluid movement and teaches you mechanics you can build on. RS throws random shit at you with every boss, has occasionally janky tile placement, and had other minor issues. Do I hate this? Not particularly. Does it require ALOT more practice than a traditional MMO to get right? Fuck yeah it does.

I'll clarify my overall statement above. If you DONT have an inate desire to keep endgame gear from other players, If you DONT support astronomical gear prices, and you DONT hate other players reaching endgame, you're not a gatekeeper. 

If one of those DOES apply, then I want you contrast how many actual grind hours it takes to get top ilvl gear in an mmo vs. runescape. Additionally Runescape is basically a single player game with SOME multiplayer aspects. You spend 10x the amount of time in runescape it takes to get to the same place in another MMO and that's by design. You and I can still both like the game, and still hate different aspect from it.

I didn't mind it at first because the normal drops weren't so bad but over time got frustrated. Then I went to do wildy slayer for t88, got interrupted a bunch of times, not that it was doing anything for my armor, but it did knock the wind out of me.

I guess I could've gotten basically carried into t90 tank, but that felt like it would defeat the purpose of IM, so I didn't want to do it. I was just having a hard time figuring out my progression path and got bored along the way. I started stumbling and never regained my footing. There are probably lots of things I should've done differently but oh well.

The barrier of entry got lowered because I'll have a much easier time with farming bosses in general now due to how necro gear is handled, which greases everything along so I can get my gear caught up more easily. Maybe I should've shot for ganodermic for mage and stuck out gwd1 for my full arma set in spite of my bad luck? I don't know.

Now at least I feel like I have some kind of hint of direction; worse comes to worse I can always press forward with necro, go back and breeze farm bosses to top off my t70 slayer gear, maybe go solo Nex for t80s, and eventually go fuck around with rax afterwards.

I think it's weird how behind the crafting skills are for the most part vs their relevant combat skill and feel it's very unintuitive, so I appreciate how necro handles things. It does need to be fleshed out some more but the beta so far feels great. I wonder if there are some changes to RC on the horizon. I don't even know where to begin with crafting, which feels like it's mostly just jewelcrafting at this stage in the game.

What we're saying is that the numbers are simply too high.  Effort should be rewarded (which is why Melee needed a buff or at least effort reduction before Necro launched), and right now, effort is actively punished if you choose to use any style other than Necro.

If necro was 10%-20% behind the other styles, with the salve amulet filling in that blank (and Jagex saying that it would launch undertuned suggested that this would be the situation), nobody would care that it lets you do GWD2 by spamming just necro basic attack after 6 hours of standing at a ritual site and crafting your own gear.

The issue is that it's waaaaaay ahead.  You could literally just delete the minions from the skill altogether.  Or delete living death & death skulls altogether, and it would still be a preferred style over melee in quite a large number of situations, in basically free gear.

It would also let you sub-optimally farm all the content to get the gear for the style you actually want to use as a catch-up mechanic.  And that should really be the level of power that it should have launched with.

Self imposed challenge. If you REQUIRE an officially supported challenge mode to perform it, that is a lack of self control issue, not a lack of latent ability / decision making ability.

Because those people have fun playing it that way. I don't have fun restricting myself. Most people don't. Is it a self control issue? Sure. Does that mean that necromancy isn't trivializing everything and making it less fun for me? No. 

> I'll clarify my overall statement above. If you DONT have an inate desire to keep endgame gear from other players, If you DONT support astronomical gear prices, and you DONT hate other players reaching endgame, you're not a gatekeeper. 

I don't care to keep endgame gear from other players. I don't support astronomical gear prices, and I don't hate other players reaching endgame. I literally don't give a shit about anybody else's progression. Most people don't.

Necromancy is still trivializing progression and making it far too easy to obtain end game gear, though. And you can say that's gatekeepy all you want but stop making my opinion about you. I don't care about you at all. 


> If one of those DOES apply, then I want you contrast how many actual grind hours it takes to get top ilvl gear in an mmo vs. runescape. Additionally Runescape is basically a single player game with SOME multiplayer aspects. You spend 10x the amount of time in runescape it takes to get to the same place in another MMO and that's by design. You and I can still both like the game, and still hate different aspect from it. I support the game being more accessible with players being able to choose thier challenge. What you support is up to you.

Yes, and that's the game. The game for the past like 20 years has been about that grind. You keep talking about accessibility but it's so obviously a load of horse shit. A lower skill *floor* would be increasing accessibility. Reduce the cost of pvm supplies, add new bosses into the progression that help ease people into pvm, etc. But no, this isn't what you want. 

> You're right that I DONT have to be full manual ever, but if I want to do everything at peak efficiency and/or the hardest bosses in game its needed. I'm sure there is some sweat god out there that can do HM Zuk in T75 gear, but that isn't me. They also wouldn't get the fastest kills times even if they did.

You don't care about accessibility. You just want ""peak efficiency"" to be handed to you on a silver platter. You don't want to put in the work to be better, you don't want to learn how to play the game. You want the game to be made easier so the gap between you and people who are better than you is smaller.

gear progression is, and as soon as you give an example rather than ""it's better than the same tier!"" (which isn't progression, it's a totally different playstyle) it would be like saying ""Necro is better than hunter, it killed hunter progression"".

If the normal progression was to go T70 melee -> T80 ranged -> T90 mage then sure, but it's not they're different styles, different playstyles, different rotations, different strengths and weaknesses.

Yeah…

Hmm…

…Can we count DKs and Matriarchs as bosses? Cause they’re the only places I can think you literally can’t use Necro. 

Even at Corp afaik Necro is comparable, cause despite the 50% reduction you still hit way fuckin’ harder. 

There could be things I’m forgetting but… I think Necro probably is meta just about everywhere it can actually deal damage.

Despite the B rune bounce, I’d probably say Necro is meta for Zam. Endless free healing, no downtime damage from conjures, 30k execute on p6/7, and considering the red bomb can *technically* splash (I think?) you can probably dodge it.

I'm sorry that you feel you can't ignore it and you feel like its mandatory for you to use. I'm sorry you let those things impact the fun you have with the game.  Somewhat like my argument for change, you like me, will have to live with whatever Jagex gives us. This time it's in my favor. Next time it'll most likely be in yours. Moving on from this section of the argument as we will definately agree to disagree here. 

Additionally, I NEVER put words in YOUR mouth. You attributed me doing so on a whim. All I did was agree with the sentiment that this game has had a pretty shit endgame culture/cost for a while. We even agree on the fact that my post DOES NOT apply to you. Yet you still fight me as if I'm targeting you.

My actual opinion is that the skill floor SHOULD be raised, the skill ceiling in regards to drop rate and/or cost SHOULD be lowered, and the cost of all things relating to it SHOULD be lowered so we have MORE endgame players. Why? Because spending hundreds of hours on what is essentially a single player game doing ""chores"" is a shit way to ""enjoy"" the game you love.

To comment on the gear portion. Yes I love my high level gear. Yes I want to be able to do endgame content at high efficientcy. I do NOT want to disinfranchinse others. If you go back and look at others posts I've made you will see again, REPEATEDLY, have pushed for QoL updates and PVM accessibility for EVERYONE. I don't need a silver platter. What I want is an alternative to having hundreds of hours or billions of gold in setbacks sometimes PER PIECE for every item I look for. There are quite a few of out here that have lives outside of the game we have to attend to, and we would like the time we spend in it to count. I don't personally feel doing nothing but grinding a single boss for months to improve one piece of my gear is rewarding for my time invested. I know you disagree with this sentiment, but that's perfectly fine.

I understand you enjoy the grind. I'm glad you have the luxury of time to be able to do it. I'm glad we agree that PVM as a whole needs some work. However, you have repeatedly assumed my take on you and my take on the game without ever asking my complete opinion. Moving forward, ask some questions before you go full blast.

Also amusing you bring player count into it, when OSRS has a much larger f2p scene, considerably more bots, alts and bad actors (scammers, lurers, etc). Does it have more numbers? Sure, I’ll give you that, but it’s not as cut and dry as you’re making it out to be.

Also amusing, cause OSRS is experimenting with an off-brand style of BLM. But sure, I guess.

I’m not claiming that increasing rare rates via BLM will save RS. Not even close. Y’know what won’t though? Claiming that going 30+ hours without progress is perfectly Ok. I’m not asking for log in 800kc, I understand that’s unsustainable, but having a scaling drop rate past 200kc without a drop won’t brick the game.

I fall on the slightly higher side of average, consistent 1:20 kills at Ras. Can you imagine your average PVMer that takes twice as long using possibly double in supplies thinking “I’ve wasted 60 hours for nothing, I’m actively losing money, but guess I’ll keep going?”, cause I sure can’t. They just won’t bother. 

I have Zuk log, Kera log, all 3 ED logs, was working on Zammy. I’m not against a grind. On the other side, Ras is miserable. Awful commons, tedious fight and is the only source of T95 Necro gear with a seemingly miserable drop rate unless you fall on the early end of the bell curve.

No, RS2 didn’t become successful from “the grind”, it was successful because most of the playerbase didn’t have a clue what was happening, and had more free time than sense. Having a skill total higher than 1200 back in the day put you pretty high on the totem pole.

Also, I’d like to point out, the devs themselves have stated they don’t want to gatekeep players from having the best equipment. Locking it behind a potentially 100+ hour, minute long boss with commons comparable to Raksha goes against that statement.",2023-08-28 20:04:05,2

>If the normal progression was to go T70 melee -> T80 ranged -> T90 mage then sure, but it's not they're different styles, different playstyles, different rotations, different strengths and weaknesses.

normal progression was whatever you could afford. you would unlock different things based on how affordable and efficient of an upgrade they were. this would allow you to progress to a state at which you would unlock better/harder content in the game. aka cinderbanes->t85 wand->t80 book->t90 wand-> gconc-> whatever you know what i mean, fill in the gaps but there was a decent amount for each style. t90 necro weapons are 10m. there is no progression here. you just buy the best thing and you're done and you're stronger than weapons in any other style which are hundreds of mils each. also you might have taken magic to some bosses and ranged to others, or at least if you're melee you might consider bringing a different style to some bosses, but this is not the case with necro. its utility, sustain and aoe outshine other styles while still being the best single target damage in the game and also being the best for tanking

Most of these are even more prevalent in OSRS. There is literally nothing that even attempts to be like it, even the singular aspects are different. Whenever i get bored or burnt out of RS3 i jump into playing my OSRS character, thats my only choice if i still want to play RS.

- Solo PVM endgame - Completely unheard of in MMOs

- Extremely sandbox - You can literally do whatever you want in any order Can find multiple ores, trees and such in many places. This is why region locked and other snowflakes arent full on trolling. In other games new content is always on some new continent or region and the old ones become completely devalued

- Progression: In any other MMO the fun only really starts at max level which is fast to achieve. Skilling matters even for mains, quests actually unlock bunch of shit and feel like adventures ( although RS3 has been moving away from this and quest bosses in pre eoc quests are piss easy now ). PvM readily available in spades without max level. Powercreep is present in RS3 but not to the extent other games do it. You can absolutely do lot of content even if you have low accuracy.

- You fend for yourself - Its usually uncharacteristic for an MMO where your own survival is your responsibility ( lack of tanks and healers ), but even compared to GW2 we have it unique. Flicking Souls Split/Other overheads, using defensives and good old moving around

- Skill ceiling - No other game can make me feel bad about my own performance as Runescape does. I can do very well in other MMOs once i get into the groves of things, but without the simplicity of Necromancy i would not even be remotely be able to perform well, despite getting used to much more skill usage in a game like FFXIV.

That's because things that are unintended, yet possible, often become necessary to perform better in PvM.

The system is basically flawed to an extreme degree, and Jagex knows that and they just roll with it. As do players.

Try doing a scarab skip in HM Nakatra with Necromany without doing a 0tick Roar Spec. 0tick, which in this case is equipping two different weapons (Roar+Ode), then doing a special attack, then swapping one of those weapons back (Ode for Skull Lantern), all in the same timeframe of 0.6 seconds, is basically necessary to do that. So you have to adjust your keybinds do to that in the heat of combat with this mechanic-intense boss without breaking your fingers, in order to perform better.

Seriously, I like Runescape and changing the tick system at this point is almost impossible because it would change everything.

**But god damn, things like that shouldn't exist.**

4ticking, 0ticking, all the yada yada about stalling, flicking, defensive autos and the integration of old systems (auto attack combat) into new systems (EoC) resulting in a mess of hidden, yet unintended, yet necessary-to-perform-better possibilities is just... sad. Nobody should have to deal with that. Those are all artifacts of the attempt of a modern game being built on the base of an old gem, and on top of the same code.

While I do enjoy the game, this can be extremely frustrating at times. Shouldn't have to do so much research about how to abuse the way a game's coding works just to enjoy a game's high-level content, or be even remotely eligible to call yourself ""good"" at PvM.",2025-03-18 13:15:37,1

I think RS does itself so well it's hard to compete with RS, but I'd love to see other devs try to do their own spin and experiment with the tick intervals also.

I think ""fast paced idle RPG"" is perfect...or just FPIRPG.

I think something needs to be coined so it's easier for people to also find other devs to look for. And honestly, I think this could even be a window for different devs/games to truly start working together. When you're idle doing abc, you can go on the other game for xyz. Imagine seeing other devs link each other to give rewards to each other.

I think this would require nodes to be more repetitive (looking at mining).  Might as well add a bigger bag for safety. But also slightly longer tick intervals to give people time to look and think.

You know iron man is the perfect hardcore RS player, but I'd love an idle iron man. Nodes last longer and you have more bag space...and you get the benefits of moving around as if you had 99 agility but still need to level agility for specific spots that require a level....and maybe to also support it, you can click anywhere on the map to travel that matches your agility level....so you don't end up idling in aggro lol",2025-03-19 03:20:56,1

When playing a game like League of Legends, it's perfect for people who want fast paced action in teams, but if you want to change things up, the options are much more limited.


Runescape, you can do quests for a more story oriented experience. you can do PVM for fast paced action. You can do afk skilling if you want to be idle. You can try to play the market at the GE. You can engage in fashion scape. You can do puzzles from minigames, clue scrolls, or quests.

Really for me the issue I have is the game is designed to be grindy, *especially* after the push for more 120 skills. While there absolutely is higher intensity methods and in general I've lived the option of DXP pushes to really smash out skills, it just all comes back to a fundamental design flaw IMO. There's so much bonus xp, MTX conveniences, and stuff like BEACH H O L E that I just don't get it. What is engaging about this? 

For me the core self-reinforcing gameplay loop when I played RS3 was ""I want to do more of the cool quests"" -> I need to train skills to this minimum to unlock quests -> quests give cool reward incentives and more gameplay.

Then, even though there are many quests they are still finite. At that point that's when I transitioned getting more into PvM, also having decent combat skills at the time. It was a process but stuff like GWD2 was an excellent middle ground of not too hard but not too easy and not too rewarding but not worthless either. It gave me a leg up on combat until slayer and then group bossing got me more wealth for more equipment. For a time Invention and chasing DPS upgrades was another cool endgame upgrade path though I wasn't a huge fan of the RNG aspects, but there were ways to mitigate it so whatever. Once (and really concurrent with) I got all BiS weapons and armor for the time, that's when I started going for more completionist cape and even trimmed stuff. It was a good cycle, and I can't complain about the amount of content I've gotten over the years. But it feels like for a while the game has been moving in the direction of grind for the sake of it. 110 or 120 skills because why? Because xp rates and MTX bonuses have made it such that 99's aren't really much of anything nowadays? Because ever more incremental diminishing return bonuses have to be locked behind huge grinds? Like, I understand they probably wrote themselves into a corner with this design, but with how rare quests became this seems to be all the game had left to flex and I just feel like they've been losing their way.

The highest level boss I've killed is Arraxor (and I had to chew through supplies) & when I want to actually sit there and learn bossing I can.

(I will be when I hit T90 Necromancy weapons so I'll have to learn Nex, and whatever the T90 power armor bosses are)

Pretty much every MMO has some kind of tick system built into their combat system - they just usually call it the global cooldown (GCD) instead. Most of your character's actions trigger on the GCD, you can queue up actions to fire on the next GCD, and you often will have a few ""interrupt"" abilities that can be triggered outside of the GCD.

They are, for all practical purposes, functionally equivalent.

Except, ironically, RS's tick is significantly faster than the GCD in most MMOs. Which means you have to act faster, in a system with objectively worse player/movement control and responsiveness, with worse ability transparency, all while dealing with an effectively invisible GCD.

Genres can only be defined by similarities to other media within that genre, and if there is no other media within that genre, it isn't a genre. I'm even willing to grant that Rocket League created its own genre, as there have been several failed attempts (as well as one or two successful ones) at creating similar games so you at least have something to work with there. Are there any games, even ones that failed, that tried to copy RuneScape's tick system?

Also the Rogue example is just patently not true and a little ridiculous, when it was released it was considered a dungeon crawler and still arguably *is*. The entire roguelike genre is, by definition, games that resemble Rogue in terms of procedurally generated dungeon crawlers with permadeath, randomized items, etc. In other words, you can tell whether or not a game is a roguelike by comparing it to Rogue. If there *were* no games that could be compared to Rogue, there would be no roguelike genre by definition. Rogue would be a top-down dungeon crawler with certain unique mechanics compared to other dungeon crawlers.

RS has a 0.6s tick and 1.8s gcd - you can do an ability every gcd, and 'other' actions every tick (multiple per tick if they don't happen to be incompatible).

FFXIV has a 2.5s gcd and dynamic 'oGCD' (off global cooldown) windows inside of that, depending on the speed of w/e ability you use in that window. Most normal abils leave you with two oGCD windows (channeled abilities usually leave you with 1). An oGCD in FFXIV is roughly equivalent to an 'other' action in RS, but there's also a whole slew of actual abilities that fit the role (like sigils / spells in RS but more variety - ex: most defensive abilities are oGCD).

In RS you can do: dbreath (ability) +w/e+w/e -> pot+w/e+w/e (actions) -> surge+w/e+w/e (actions) -> next ability.

In FFXIV you can do: toxicon (ability) -> pot (ogcd) -> haima (ogcd) -> next ability.

Having played through most of the hardest pvm content in both games, on balance, you weave more regularly at all levels of play in FFXIV (oGCDs are essential for most basic rotations). But high level RS play pumps way more APM into complex weaves, on top of a less rigid rotational base with more dynamism.

High level RS play is: do lots of very complex, tick perfect ability / action weaves with not very much motion (recent bosses have started to go more in this direction but nothing to FF's extent).

High level FF play is: do highly rigid ability / action weaves (in sync w/ team, rotational drift can be really bad as it fucks the timing of everyone's buff windows) while executing very complex, tick perfect motion and puzzle solves.

Imo RS has way more room for optimization and skill expression in the tick-ability combat system itself, but it's not because it's faster paced. It's because there's more choices in what buttons to press moment to moment. All the crazy hybrid shit and eof / spec weapon switches, etc etc. Even just the base abilities of each class.

Whereas in FF you do your 2min buff, do burst rot, if you drifted from team your damage is terrible, if you didn't drift you did good, then filler until 2min comes back. It's like RS combat from before EOF release, when range was green magic (sun on 1min, thresholds, filler, repeat, sometimes apot).

For RuneScape, this idea is even more ridiculous. Death Stranding is a fairly new release, so maybe Kojima will ultimately be right and we will see an explosion of new games incorporating elements from it. He *has* been a pioneer of the stealth genre in the past, that much is true. RuneScape, on the other hand, has had 0.6s ticks for two and a half decades now. Even if you mark EoC as the genesis of this supposed new genre, that was 12 years ago. If RuneScape has pioneered this mythical new genre, why haven't any other games been made in it? You don't get to claim a game 'created a new genre' when that genre hasn't actually emerged for over a decade.

So what do people do?  Repeatedly click.  Whether it's panic, wanting to make sure one of the commands go through, or something else it doesn't matter.  But then the problem becomes the rubberband that bounces you around.

Your comparison to speedruns is... just plain unfitting, but proves my point at the same time. The vast, vast majority of speedruns is about singleplayer games, where often an astonishing amount of glitches are used to skip large parts of the game. So far, so good. But Runescape is a multiplayer game. It's not possible, and you're not supposed to skip large parts of the game's overall progression (which, for Runescape, is mostly questing and skilling) - that would give you an extremely unfair advantage over other players (which wouldn't be an issue at all in single player games), and would be fixed immediately. .

What you can do in Runescape, however, is skip certain boss mechanics. It doesn't give you an extreme edge over other players besides slightly (or clearly) better kill times, and therefore better revenue. But in order to do this at all, you need to abuse the tick system. Which is absolutely possible. Which, in turn, means that the tick system is... Glitched? Badly implemented? Call it however you want, but if you're comparing it to speedruns by yourself then you are probably aware that something's not right.

To each their own, I don't mind. Though as a matter of fact, Runescape is a multiplayer game running on some serious spaghetti-frankenstein-code. They tried copying elements from other games with EoC, but none of the things that Jagex attempted to do all those years ago with EoC are well-implemented, as they are merely new mechanics added on top of the already existing combat system. The result was just broken code and/or an abnormal amount abusable game mechanics in a tick system that was already prone to errors, neither of which should be the case in a *multiplayer game*.

Its kinda of stupid how rather than the it being based off who can solve the mystery and it being cryptic, it was based off of ""who can level up the fastest and stay awake an unhealthy amount and not sleep!"" 

either A: make it so getting the first of lore related content is based on the ability to level up faster than everyone else, or B: dont bother including it. or C: do better and dont make some of the mysteries braindead easy by giving it a clear level requirement or RNG requirement. 

for example hows somebody supposed to solve the mystery of fixing the portal to get up to stromguard unless they beat those who are grinding out levels faster than you and clearing going for hiscores.

obviously le me/maikeru would be the first to figure out basic mysteries because they were the ones going for the levels faster than anyone else.

Right now I think the biggest gripes were some RNG mitigation for Imcando, and the overcrowding of caches (because of so many people playing).

I know this sounds like a ""big"" suggestion, but the 99 perk fells very... lackluster. I would maybe have the elite outfit to change your tele location with journal or outfit to the monolith, and have the 99 perk actually help with the skill.

Maybe I'm wrong, but considering the cost attributed with the monolith changes, it's not something we'll be constantly changing on the fly.

Most other gatherer perks help with the skill, and you guys removed redundant skillcape perks previously (like smithing). Maybe the time sprite stays for longer. Or maybe the time sprite benefit is 12% or 15% instead of 10%. Or something more inventive that I can't think of. 

**Besides that**, I would recommend adjusting the color or visibility of the Time Sprite. Sometimes (especially on lower graphics or different skyboxes), it can be quite hard to see.

Additionally, some materials only have one cache for them (like third age iron, and goldrune), and given some cache crowding, maybe it makes sense to add more behind some higher level/quest-locked areas. Like Vulcanized Rubber cache within the lava flow mines, or some lore-related material within Glacor Cave, etc...

It is for the most part a very well structured skill, with a singular; fatal flaw.

**Time Sprite**  
The Time Sprite Mechanic is an excellent incentive to lean-forward gameplay, similar to Rockertunities. I have had several people mention that they have had trouble seeing the Time Sprite due to colour conflicting - This is not an issue for myself, but can understand it for other players.

**Excavations**  
There are several that identify as *insert excavation site name here* and you can often feel lost finding the correct one as they all identify as the soil name. Having the level in the undiscovered excavations would alleviate this issue.

**Sites**  
This is the best part about the skill. Each Archaeology site feels completely unique and has its own small mechanics within them. It really does make each site feel unique and diverse while following the same core flow of the skill.

**The Fatal Flaw**  
Archaeology is categorised as a Gathering skill, which by-design feels directly against what a Gathering skill is. The tradeable aspect of the skill - Materials funds into the skill itself.  

Materials being tradeable is the largest issue in the skill. The competition at material caches can be downright unbearable. It is a ""Gathering skill"" which is purchasable by resources within the same skill itself. This purchasable aspect of the skill has brought a lot of attention from bots and alting.

*Divination did have this to an extent with Energy; but the linear design of Divination on release made it far less prevalent.
The stagnation in Archaeology causes this to be a far bigger issue; making a Level 25 material relevant to Level 118 players - which is entirely purchasable. This stagnation also creates bottlenecks as you can never ahead of the level curve; as there is no curve.*

The skill should have been categorised as an Elite skill or a Support skill with non-tradeable materials. Material caches should have then been instanced on a per-player basis to entirely remove competition; alt-usage; giving bot farms an incentive to bot the skill and world-hop spamming - the last which has gotten some people **locked out of the game for several hours** due to a poor design aspect for the skill.

tl;dr: Yes, I am saying that it should have been a ""self-Ironman"" skill for training.

With the flaw out of the way; let's get into a suggestion.

**Suggestion: Grand Caches**  
Gathering from a Level 25 cache at Level 74 Archaeology is just.... why? - You need the material but you just won't get XP that is worth it. At 20 levels above the initial cache level should be a Grand Cache.  
Grand Caches would be - in short - an improved material cache. They would award appropriate experience rates to be appropriate for their level; a confirmed minimum amount of resources per cache and a small percentage chance for a double material excavation.  
Grand Caches would be obtainable for all Materials.",2020-04-07 21:33:46,7

To at least honor the mods and Gower brothers who worked on the quest that would inspire Archeology to be a skill more than a decade and a half later. It also doesn't make sense lorewise that people who didn't finish the quest can get permission to dig up valueble artefacts without the level 3 certification or even access the digsites when the quest The digsite made archeology a strict undertaking.

Might also suggest to put in some additional skill requirements for some material caches related to the area where those caches are located. Like for example the one in slayer tower has some slayer level req and those near daemonheim have DG req, feldip hills have some hunter req and so on. To weed out some alts hogging caches.

Can we also have some additional cache for those locations especially in quest locked areas like those behind the world gate and in seldom visited locations like Ashdale, Dragontooth Isle, Entrana, Dorgeshuun. Materials like Leather scraps which only have one material cache could also use more caches in other locations.

A NPC that will hold onto your damaged artefacts, and requires a portion of the repair materials (maybe 25%?) to withdraw them.

So as an example there's the Kal-i-kran warhorn that I got from my first tetracompass, that requires 115 Arch. I could store it with the NPC, then once I reach 115 Arch, I could pay 11 Vulcanized Rubber; 10 Fossilized bone; and 10 animal furs, to let me withdraw it.

This would allow us to avoid the conundrum of having to choose between losing a bank space for possibly months, or throwing away a reward we got, that is of actual use down the road. But it hopefully wouldn't lead to too much of a benefit to the player, as free storage.

In terms of ""theming"", maybe have the [now-removed NPC](https://runescape.wiki/w/Workman_(museum\)) who used to deliver the wheelbarrows of dirt/artefacts to the museum take on the role, since his job is defunct with the archeology guild having opened up and brought traffic to the digsite.",2020-04-10 02:56:01,1

* Imcando under Ice Mountain. We are only are able to access the ruined Hall of Camdozaal. I guess it'd be a Saradomin aligned site since the Imcando allied to Saradomin because of Zamorak turning dwarves into Chaos Dwarves. (Defender of Varrock Quest)
* Dareeyak. Ruins of a Zarosian fortress. Level 21-24 west wildy. (Spirit of Summer and Summer's End quests) also mentioned in armies of gielinor
* Damonheim. There's a lot on the surface around the dungeon.
* Cranador. Area is in desperate need of a graphic overhaul. You'd only known from dialouge that it was once a thriving community of mages and adventurers.
* Eastbridge from armies of gielinor
* Ghorrock? Maybe it housed another artefact aside from Frostenhorn?
* Lassar the Zarosian fortress on/in? White Wolf Mountain
* Paddewwa the Zarosian fortress in Edgeville? Possibly those ruins?
* More of Senntisten at the digsite
* Just about any world through the world gate like Tarddiad, Kethsi, Yu'biusk, Naragun, etc. Most of them are in ruins.
* Uzer
* Arposandra
* [The Underwater City](https://runescape.wiki/w/Underwater_city)

smithing is far too slow to get bulk weapons/armor needed for disassembly  now. GL buying the lower to mid level equipment  you need from the ge to get components cause it aint gonna happen  


all ore are going to crash to their high alch value at some point, because its so ooooooooo easy to mine ore now and there is less demand for ore because, again smithing  an item is slow as fuck, and you need to smith far less items to gain xp.

- Stone spirits are next to worthless (they're going to look into it). If they were planning on keeping the economy mostly intact, and old ores obviously are going to decline in price because of demand how is it a good idea to add stone spirits with the same tier and the equivalent number?

- Items in stores touched by the rework are now so expensive it's no longer worth doing shop runs. This especially troubles iron accounts.

- A reference item yields the same number of materials as any upgraded variant. This makes no sense at all.

- You cannot empty your ore box in the deposit interface.

Especially one of such high quality? You even put ""fuck smithing rework"" in your flair, which just goes to show how ignorant and childish you are. If you had put the 45 minutes it probably took you to string together those 2 sentences into instead paying attention to anything else going on for 5 seconds you would've already seen what the developers' plans are for adjusting as things go on when it comes to drop tables (despite the fact that it's common sense that they would need to do some tweaking after implementing something with wide economic effects; you've made it clear, however, that you lack the capability of using common sense).

And even then, its hasn't at all been an ""insane nerf"", you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. In some instances, yes, certain drops on some tables have seen decreases for that specific ore drops, but it has by no mean severely effected the majority of PvM content in the game to the degree that you're implying.

Which leads nicely into the next point about the spring cleaner. In many cases, the devs have overcompensated when it comes to how spring cleanable drops were changed by making them worth more than before based on alch prices. Some are not going to be quite as good as they were before since they aren't being dismantled into rune ore anymore, but rune ore isn't worth nearly as much so doing so no longer makes sense. Most people view the spring cleaner changes as improvements since now less valuable drops that would previously have had to be manually disassembled can be done so automatically for free, and the more valuable don't have to be manually alched anymore. So I don't know what the fuck you think you're talking about saying it has been ""essentially removed from the game"" but it makes you look like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Prior to the rework, literally half of the functionality of the spring cleaner was utterly useless as no one used research mode, whereas now every function is actually useful. 

Next time before you comment, think about what you wanted to say, and if it sounds like something a 9 year old would think, I would probably consider just not doing so. But that's just me.",2019-01-08 17:20:19,10

They are finally leveling items to what they should be and making them matter, which is awesome. Yeah, there was a slight difference in using a lower-tiered tool before this, but now it is much more apparent. 

In regards to his comment in regards to smithing seeming slow: my response stands. Smithing is a challenging skill and back in the day, people would pay premium prices for metalwork. That's where this update was intended to take the Smithing skill, and it did. I made nearly 60m today just by smithing.

Few bits of feedback other than things I think you guys are aware of:

\-Dragonbane swords are quite underwhelming. I was trying one out on a rune dragon (an extreme example I know, but still) and was splashing like mad (before it became immune to melee, but that's a different issue). The problem here is that most dragons worth killing have decent resistance to melee weaponry. 

\-Why is the Pick of Song and Earth made at a usual anvil if it's made using a blast fusion hammer? I feel as if it would be more appropriate to make this at the dragon forge, just like the dragon platebody.

\-Signs of the porter aren't banking any ore. Also, the list of things they can bank when you inspect one hasn't been updated to reflect the new name of bane, and i don't think it listed the new ore or geodes.

\-I really think the Master clue scroll to make a Rune Full Helmet needs to be updated to Smelt an Elder Rune bar, as it's a massive reduction in the smithing requirement (and an increase in the time taken to do the clue).

\-What was wrong with Tinker's old effect? Personal opinion, keep Tinker as it is live (also to reduce the number of perks with M/S exceptional behaviour), give Rapid the current Beta effect of Tinker, and create a new perk to have the Beta effect of Rapid.

*I've created a new account just for the beta, I'll update my feedback here*

* Tutorial Island worked fine.
    * The Mining and Smithing tutorial section was cluttered with the massive interface.
    * I suggest limiting what a player can see for the tutorial.
* The bronze dagger that's created on the island and given during The Blood's Pact is incredibly weak.
    * Damage: 48 -> 9, Accuracy 150 -> 110
    * This makes killing the rat/NPC's ages to do.
    * I suggest not nerfing Bronze equipement, or providing a stronger alternative.
        * Nerfing NPCs isn't an option since other non-metal weapons haven't been adjusted.
* The ""Mine 3 Copper"" Daily/Path challenge adapts to the rocks appropriately.
    * You don't turn in the ore, you just get XP.
* Most Bronze weapons (and most likely armor) is weaker than live.
    * This is an issue as described above since equivalent gear in Ranged/Magic or quest weapons are stronger.
* Low levels/Skillers take Bear aggro near the mine east of Ardy.
    * It isn't necessary to do anything here, but just a point of reference.

**Core Training**

* Low Level scaling between Mining and Smithing doesn't appear to be right.
    * I gained over 20 Mining levels (1-20) before having enough materials to reach level 10 Smithing.
    * Reduce the XP on low-end mining, or improve the xp with Smithing.
    * The XP between the two skills shouldn't be more than doubled in my opinion. (Level 17 mining max).
* The mining site outside of Falador should have iron and/or coal, not just silver.
    * A mining site of just silver isn't that good especially when it used to have iron and coal.
* The Mining hit splats block line of sight of the character model.
    * Please make these smaller so I can see my character.
* The Smithing bars hide player text/covered by player text.
    * I'd like to see chat, or my bar depending on the issue.
* Ceremonial Sword message pop-ups occur every-time you interact with an anvil.
    * The problem is if you have a scroll (awarded one), you are forced to do it or bank it otherwise it's annoying.",2018-11-13 16:49:55,92

Hello !

First of all, the Mining & Smithing rework will be, in my opinion, one of the best update *Runescape* had had this past two years or so. Indeed, the mining feels great, the rate at which you gain ore feels satisfying and the smelting is engaging and fun.

But, my only concern is the lack of feedback from completing an object. Let me explain, you start off by heating the *smithing object*, raising its heat bar, then pounding away on the Anvil. Spark starts flying out ; spark' color and the pounding sound represents the percent (%) of the heat bar, that feels good. Even by heating up the object you get audible and visual feedback.

However, on-completion; you get a small text box written : ""You finish smithing : (...) +X"". No musical cue, no visual feedback, no satisfying pop-up. What I suggest is one or more of the following :

1. A visual feedback of some sort other than a text box.
2. An animation brandishing the finished object.
3. A sound cue representing ""success"".
4. A particle system similar to like the one you get from leveling up a skill.

And the last but none the least,

5. A big chunk of experience

To avoid raising the intended exp rate, maybe the experience gained by smithing the object could be redistributed at the completion (lower the experience gained while smithing and redistribute the difference at the end (Like cleansing stone) ), or even just a big chunk of experience on top of the current experience gained.

Also, there's a **bug** when you're trying to smith a burial object; on-click of *Begin Project*, you get the following : ""You lack the requirements to create a (...) +4"" even thought *Burial* is selected and all the indicator are green.

By selecting/deselecting *Burial* and *+4* button, it fixes the issue, but still.

Anyhow, that's my personal feedback on the Beta, I am looking forward to hear what you guys have to say about that.",2018-11-13 16:50:04,29

- Pure essence feels the same as it did before the rework. This is probably intended?

- Mining soft clay in Ithell district, again, feels about the same as pre-rework. Got a few sediment geodes, which gave garbage gems, which makes sense. The geodes stacking is very nice.

- Gem rocks feel very broken ATM, unless this is intended. The XP is pretty good, getting tons of gems, and even more in the form of geodes. LOTS of people are getting onyx, so I'm wondering if the rate was raised, or it's just luck. Getting 3-5 dragonstones per inventory, especially for ironmen, feel like it'll mess with the economy... unless their prices have also changed, which I haven't checked yet. Not a fan of the ""rare"" geodes I'm getting from gem rocks giving jade and opal, though, when the rocks themselves are giving rubies, diamonds and dragonstones.

- Gem rocks in general seem broken. Have gems been removed from drop tables? People don't seem to know, but if so, that would explain how ""broken"" gem rocks are. I got 1 onyx, 30 dragonstones, and something like 60 diamonds in 5 inventories at gem rocks.

- Again, you can make 28 pieces of jewelry per inventory now, on top of the gems being easier. This needs very careful balancing.

- Divine locations receive no buffs and still capped at rune. Will this be changed, ever?

- Seem to be getting worse XP/hour from drakolith ore than from mining wet clay in Ithell. Intended?

- It's somewhat difficult to see rockertunities when there's other players around. Would we ever get the option to have different colors or styles, similar to how we have different loot beam overrides?

- Gem rocks in Prif seem to be leagues better than the gem rocks in the Kal'gerion resource dungeon, which requires 90 Dungeoneering. I see that the stats on the rocks are different, but the Prif rock seems to give far better gems. Tons of rubies vs tons of diamonds and dragonstones. Is this intentional? Is it possible to give this other high level rock a niche use?",2018-11-13 18:40:13,8

Something just feels off about the fact you need the metal tier you want to mine to make a box that can hold that tier. It would feel smoother/more intuitive imo if the tiers were shifted down one - so like a bronze ore box could hold iron so that you have an ore box usable for iron ore when you first go to mine iron rather than having to mine a bit to smith a box that helps you mine it.

Kinda like how the divination boons can all be made with the prior tier of energy.

Arguably you could even play with the capacity to balance things and keep elder rune box relevant by making it so that it can only hold like 25-50 of the next tier up ores so you'd still want to get an iron box asap once you move on to iron, but your bronze box would at least give you some basic functionality.",2018-11-13 18:10:08,27

I essentially never pushed the levels past 85 once i realized rune was becoming worthless. I've only put about 2 hours in so far:

&#x200B;

**Overall**

* This may be the game's best update in a couple of years
* I'm glad to see makeable armor and weapons removed from PvM.
* Being given a choice to go AFK/Low XP or Active/High XP is excellent

&#x200B;

**Mining**

* The new mining mechanics are fantastic, the removal of competition is huge. I actually had my first conversation with someone while mining in over 10 years, instead of just racing to rocks for a single ore, great job.
* The rock graphics look cartoonish, i can live with them if it's a huge deal to change, but they could have been done better
* Being able to add filters to the world map by ore type would be huge, it took me a while to find the ores i wanted to mine
* XP rates seem very high in relation to smithing, these need to be evaluated and aligned more closely to smithing XP rates, assuming you use everything you mine to smith, these skills should level up at similar rates, with the current rates, you could max mining far before you would smithing.
* An explanation on how pickaxe stats and rock stats work, and how it affects ore gathering rates would be cool
* New graphics for ores in inventory would be nice, again, not urgent

&#x200B;

**Smithing**

* The ability to now upgrade armor and weapons within a tier is fantastic, I've been waiting for this for a long time. This gives players a decent amount of options when it comes to gearing, almost makes smithing feel like real smithing, and makes the skill more fun to train, while giving several different methods of training based on your goals.
* A enhancement to the heat visual indicator and tool tip to show xp decrease thresholds would be a good addition
* Smelting interface doesn't remember the amount of bars you wish to smelt when re-opening, always resets to 1, max would be more practical
* Ability to gain extra bars while smelting is fantastic
* It would be nice to be able to stage multiple unfinished items instead of needing to work one at a time before choosing the next (ex. if i want to create 5 platebodies) - Not sure if i'm just not seeing this option somewhere else",2018-11-14 16:41:33,9

* Addy, Luminite, and Runite don't have many viable location in F2P.
    * Crandor is a useless location as it requires passing by the Karamja Runite mine.
          * Requires 90 steel nails and 3 planks as an option only while Dragon Slayer is started (not complete).
    * Rimmington Mine Addy Ores are too spread out.
* West Falador Mine is now a random Silver only mine.
    * This mine should provide Coal and Iron.
* The only F2P Luminite Mine (not in the mining guild) has aggressive Scorpions 

**Mining Hubs**

* Players will naturally make central hubs where the following criteria is met:
    * Closest to a bank.
    * Provides a significant benefit.
    * Contains a particular bar recipe (Coal + Mith, Addy/Rune + Lumi)
* Therefore don't limit the number of diverse locations in fear of there not being a community hub.
* Keep in mind surrounding creatures that are aggressive to new players (this seems to be ignored).
* DO NOT FORCE WILDERNESS ACTIVITIES (this may not be an issue currently but it's important).


**Rocks**

* They look terrible and out of place as they do not blend into the environment.
    * Give them better textures, and make them smaller.
* A ton of rocks stuck in terrain don't give off the Rockortunities effect.
* Mithril (the ore and armor look like tin/steel) in standard lighting (Varrock).
    * Please make the color the same as the icons (not bright blue grey).

If I may offer a non-lore reason why the suggestion makes sense, then: A lot of people do know the blast fusion hammer as 'the dragon lava forge hammer thing' because we know we make a dragon platebody there. Thus, when we first came to make it, having not seen it on the interface but knowing the recipe involved the hammer, we all immediately went to the Dragon Forge and spent 5 minutes wondering how to make it work, before eventually I gave up, went to try some normal smithing and found the recipe there when I checked out of curiosity of maybe it was there.

- i hope its already known, but incase it isnt: many existing armour/weapons didnt get converted to tokens

- Armour spikes' damage get influenced by flat damage modifiers like demon slayer armour pieces(only helm, boots and gloves, as body/legs needs to be melee for the spikes to work), ghost hunter pieces(helm and backpack),and the invention demon/undead/dragon slayer perks, and i guess its not intended because of this debug msg https://puu.sh/C5SeR.png also the thorns damage from bane shields https://puu.sh/C7ztC.png

considering how slow armour spikes are to make, they shouldnt be automatically lost on death.

- The Alch mode of the Spring Cleaner doesn't work at all when killing monsters in the wilderness, im guessing its because all gp obtained there is forced into the inventory instead going to the money pouch and the code doesnt handle for that.

In the other hand the Alch mode works 100% of the time when killing stuff elsewhere, which **imo** shouldn't be the case since the Dismantle mode doesn't work 100% of the time. Yeah with the current *Spring* price we would pay nearly x9 the price of a nature rune for that alch, but for for everything stay the same i think it would be better to make 1 spring give 10 charges on the cleaner and each alch consume 1 charge per use while keeping the current non-100% proc rate to ""force"" people to bring both spring cleaner and natures like it happen right now. The Research mode would cost 10 charges per use, or change it to also consume only 1 charge for it to finally become economically viable to use.

- The tuned version of bane weapons: im not a fan of how they are atm, but i get they are in a very complicated spot. Aside directly competing which chaotics (that don't have any plans mentioned on the docs, or i was to blind to find it), theres no variety on them. I think each tuned weapon could be of a different type to reflect their use and synergy with the possible weapon diversity update: like the 2h abyssal bane being a halberd, dw revenant bane being maces and the 2h dragon bane a spear. idk its just an idea.

Stone spirits looks like very big issue currently. In F2P there is literally no enemies dropping luminite or runite stone spirits. Kbd and Giant mole maybe can but didn't bother waste too much time. I killed about 30 kbd, got twice 1x necrite stone spirit, which is p2p so those probably replaced either adamant/rune bars or runite ores. I got 100 silver and 50 gold stone spirits. Killed only 7 hm moles which none gave me anything m&s related. Even Adamant stone spirits seem to be dropped only by very few enemies.

Suggesting to give more stone spirits in F2P, less salvages.

Generally replacing directly 1:1 bars to stone spirits is not good idea as currently rune/adamant bars are worth much more than stone spirits will be. If looking Barbarian Assault gambling rewards, bars give about 90k profit, torstol seeds give under 5k. I fear 1:1 replaced stone spirits will not give much more than 5k either.",2018-11-28 21:10:32,3

Most ore rates/xp rates felt good. I was getting coal and gold at a rate of 1 ore per swing, mith at one per two swings, rune at 3-4 swings.

The issue comes then, with ores like iron (and copper/tin too but they are used less so it tends to bother you less). Iron also comes at one per swing, the same as those higher level ores. Which feels a bit frustrating when you used to be able to power mine it much faster. 

Being able to do something like Hall of Memories 2 ticking on iron rocks to get iron at a faster rate would be a nice addition. Possibly add it as a similar mechanic as multiple runes? If you are x many levels above the level to mine it you can start 2 ticking it.",2018-11-14 18:38:43,2

Overall feedback? Glad it's still good ol' Bertha, but she can't stay in her current beta form when the rework goes fully live.

Positive points:

- The stupid ""add all ores to belt"" dialogue is gone. No more having to click multiple times (up to 16 times for 1 inventory of ore and a coal bag worth of coal pre-rework). This has been dumb ever since it was added so thanks for getting rid of it, huge QoL update when combined with the fact blast furnace now requires no secondaries at all.

- Left-click to cool the bars. This has been sorely needed for a long time as well.

Bad points:

- The stupid ""are you sure"" dialogue on the conveyor may be gone but the conveyor has instead been rendered completely unuseable. Left-clicking forces you to load ores 1 by 1 (28 clicks ffs) and you can't even just spamclick it, you have to time the clicks to fit perfectly with the ticks to get the ore to go on. There's not even a right-click to add all ore to the belt. Please for the love of Guthix make it so left-click adds all ore to belt.

Things which I think need further consideration:

- It'd be nice if loading the coke into the furnace was automated a la the ectofuntus bone grinder. The double click feels outdated compared to the rest of Rs3 which has become much more QoL focused.

- Blast furnace currently does not seem to work with the new extra bar mechanic present on normal furnaces. Obviously if you're smelting in 28s and an extra bar gets made then it has nowhere to go. May be worth considering whether the blast furnace ought to deposit directly into the hopper to overcome this in order to keep it competitive with normal smelting since otherwise the extra bars from normal furnaces are inevitably going to make blast furnace useless.

**Positives**

- Smithing feels right and good. I'd hate to train this skill all over again but the rates look pretty good and its afk enough but with a bonus for focusing. 
- Mining isnt a fistfight anymore for rocks. I love this.
- I can make armor and weapons quickly for usage, but spend more time crafting something especially useful.
- Adds balancing to the economy. 
- Makes mining more competitively profitable (especially with gems) please do not nerf!
- Makes smithing competitively profitable (yay for skillers!)

**Negatives**

- Overall love the mechanics and fixes to the two skills. This was worth the wait. I love the update and it looks nearly ok for January.
- Blocked deposit box in dwarven mine is an issue
- Deposit all button doesnt seem to work on smithing interfaces
- Dragons (and other bar dropping monsters) should drop the stone spirits of the secondary ores. This feels like an oversight but I think it is important.
- **DO NOT NERF THE PRIFF GEM ROCK** It provides an excellent mining distraction money maker. If everyone is mining ores then the prices goes down. This provides a solid way of being able to mine and make approximately 4-5m/hr. The onyxes can be alched for cash. Miners will do that till PVM players decide to pay them properly then they will mine more ores. The market balances out really well and I love it! The issue is it kills crafting. PVM is going to take a bit of a hit specifically demon and dragon slaying. But the upside is this really helps out Ironmen so they arent doing bossing to get onyxes (to then do bossing ironically).
- We need a few more ""overloads"" for the skill. A defensive version of the spikes. It just absorbs the same amount of damage the attacking one does. **The game needs more tanks**
- It would be nice if Bane consumed a few more PVM items to help with economic stability. The things you can make Bane against are kinda limited. Bane looks to be the strongest known metal of the 2nd age and the metal used by Zaros' army primially. So maybe more above ground Slayer creatures as they would have been the main issue to deal with.   
- Now my main gripe, Phantasmite. I know it needs to be near ""ghostly"" locations, but man is this stuff hard to locate and export efficiently. The most efficient place (playthru vs bank time) was the Hunted mine and that still required the drakan medallion.
- Im worried about what happens to Ports armors. They seem pointless now. They have a set effect to help with the Arc but is that enough? I feel like they should have the same effects as the Raids armors, just be tier 85/80.


**Questions**
Mostly Lore stuff

- So is Barrows armor Necrite with gold instead of Phantasmite? Phantasmite seems like it would be unavailable and unknown at the time. Colors seem to line up and it requires gold coinage to repair. So maybe it is made of Necrite that has been saturated with gold? Like a tooth filling.
- Same idea with Torva, Bane and gold?
- Is Runite a ceramic? Its a sedimentary rock that gets melted down with another sedimentary rock. No telling what is in there, but it appears to be stronger than steel when hit, but it can oxidize. Same question for Mithril and Adamant. I'd imagine Adamant is made of crushed up gems.
- Light anima appears in places gods committed acts of self sacrifice?
- Dark anima appears in places where gods where wounded but not killed? Both Zaros and the hydra god where attacked there, but Zaros was only wounded.
- Is Dark Anima Light Anima corrupted with Dealyte?
- What is Dealyte?
- In swan song there is a joke about smithing... what is gonna happen with that?",2018-11-14 23:39:37,3
Mining & Smithing Rework,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9wo5by/mining_smithing_beta_official_feedback_thread/,9wo5by,e9p0fwh,None,"Currently on the beta you can withdraw and deposit items in to the metal bank in the wilderness (level 55) even while in combat. I feel that this strongly discourages risk/reward gameplay that the wild is intended for, instead just encouraging skillers to simply deposit very, very frequently, bring very few items, and let theirselves die to PKers. This is very unproductive and generally unexciting gameplay.

My suggestion would be to remove the metal bank and increase the speed at which you mine ore in the wilderness locations, with this being further boosted by using a demonic skull (ie. 10% faster and 30% faster with demonic skull). This would make it a more exciting and worthwhile place to mine, offering better profit and EXP for those who are able to aptly defend theirselves.

I'd like it if ore boxes (but not their contents) were always kept on death, as this would give incentive to players to stay longer, have their inventory not cluttered with ore - instead having food and other combat related items - setting them up to not be punching bags.

Also - when you try to mine ore with a full inventory (and an ore box!) it tells you 

""Your backpack is full. Click the ore box to store ore."" I have no ore in my inventory, I have foot, potions, runes, gear. You shouldn't be handicapping skillers by an extra inventory space - the ore should go straight to your ore box while you're in the wild. It's also very annoying have to deposit your ores in to your bag every single time you mine an ore - it breaks things up in a bad way. The wild should be more convenient in terms of the actual skilling (ignoring the danger of being in the wild), not less convenient! It's especially awful when you get a rocktunity

I'd also love to see the effects of various mining buffs lumped on to the player when they mine in the wild as well, this would once again encourage them to bring actual combat gear and fight back/be prepared to run away in the case of a PVP fight.

Also, nearby this mining location is the wilderness agility course; currently you can walk in and out of this until you're out of combat and then log out - against a single person there's basically no counterplay since you can't attack them while they're on the crossing and such. This was already an issue for the wilderness agility course, but now this incredibly easy escape route is available for yet another piece of content - I'd love to see that fixed somehow as it just makes things far too safe. 

Love the feeling of mining - rocktunities are fun and it feels good seeing your progress towards an ore. I'd enjoy if rocktunities had a noise when they pop up, it'd add a bit of excitement for me personally.",2018-11-14 18:13:17,3

Enjoy the mining aspect on my maxed account. Haven't really tried smithing yet, just been mining the items I need to make elder rune to try that out. I don't know how deeply I'll dig in during a beta but want to try a few things.

I had my old school account that hasn't done rs3 yet. Decided to start it up. Unless I'm missing something, the biggest issue I'm seeing is that I'm getting a LOT more mining than smithing xp.

The Elder Rune Pickaxe +5 looks really underwhelming, and since it will be in many people's toolbelts (as opposed to the earth and song which is augmented), I think it should look suitably epic. Even some of the new lower level pickaxes like the t60 and t80 ones look better. I'm also not sure why you keep making these one headed pickaxes instead of the traditional 2 headed ones. Lastly, especially compared to the bane pickaxe +4, the elder rune pickaxe+5 looks really blunt. I dunno, making the model lightly larger and sharpening the point might be all it needs.

1. I really like that the ore box doesn't require a huge number of ores. It's great for the players who might be starting at 1 Mining and Smithing who can use their hard work to make their own ore box. The upgrade system is good.
2. Smithing is generally very intuitive. Good job. Only issue I'm having is it's not clear why I can't make Burial armour, despite having a Elder Rune Helm+5. I'll figure it out.
3. Having the metal bank is a huge advantage to the update - it keeps it clean and easy to access. It also makes making Rings of Slaying easier.
4. Having looked at how many materials you need for Trimmed Masterwork, I think it's a great design choice. It's going to be HELLA expensive to make, and for good reason. That gives skillers a big moneymaking opportunity, I love it.

The bane melee weapons and armor can do more work though. The tuned bane weapons are kind of useless now without the accuracy and affinity boost since they will splash so much. At the very least, monsters weak to bane ammo should be weak to bane melee weapons as well, so the affinity will be 90 when using them. Maybe there can be a set effect for bane armor for increase accuracy against tuned monsters. There should also be a tune bane weapon with 2 range as well, otherwise people will rather use dragon rider lance or noxious syat abyssal demons since they can hit more targets.",2018-11-16 12:53:35,1

Although a rune platebody only needs 50 Smithing, I was nonetheless notified that I need 99 Smithing to build a rune armour stand. At a minimum, the requirements for those pieces of furniture should probably be lowered to 30/40/50 in line with the new levels for mithril/adamant/rune platebodies (the decision will also need to be made on whether to use base items of maximally tempered ones). Better still, if we could also start building orichalkum through elder rune armour stands for our house.

My other point is more of a question: will we eventually be getting more variety of weapons for the new metal tiers? The current selection of a single one-handed plus two-handed weapon type works fine enough for now, but I think it'd be particularly important to have, say, necronium daggers and elder rune maces once the weapon diversity project is completed.

Mining & Smithing Rework,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9wo5by/mining_smithing_beta_official_feedback_thread/,9wo5by,eajuq7z,AzuraSkyy," Superheating used to be a great profitable, click intense training method for low smithing xp and magic xp. The tick rate seems to be reduced and a message prompt displayed anytime you try to oversample the superheat spell. I noticed superheating within the workshop uses ores from the ore bank and only requires a single runite ore in the inventory. I don't understand this change. It seems to me the reason for the change in tick rate is strictly related to the fact that it requires no mouse movement. I think it makes far more sense to remove the ore bank withdraw while superheating in the workshop and revert the tick rate. I tested this with an ore box as well.  


Currently in the live game you can reasonably superheat 2000 rune bars/hr for a total of 106k magic xp and 100k smithing xp. In the beta I'm only able to reach 75k magic xp and 20k smithing xp with high effort filling my ore box and superheating at the bank (this would increase \~5% in the artisans workshop). I should note that superheat form at a furnace requires no clicking and uses the live game superheat rate while using no nature runes or effort. I believe superheating requires only one change which is to make it in line with the superheat form smelting rate.  


I'm not opposed to the update in general but I don't understand why superheat is being neutered.",2018-11-27 04:32:23,1

I think a big issue is that outside of a few particular mechanics like KK or Raxx OHKOs (which I guess are bugged with regarrds to the passive) it doesn't really add much new potential to any fight as we were never in that much danger to begin with; see people using nihils and no fooding most bosses.

What I personally think would be a better effect is for it to somehow store a percentage of the damage you do and instead release that all in one go, so it a) doesn't increase your overall dps over a long fight (in a significant way) but b) does increase your burst dps which definitely has more practical uses at bosses. Also I would suggest this effect to be an active one ie. you activate it once for it to store up the damage say over 1 minute then activate again to release it, will approprate cooldowns. There could also be potential for it to rely more on irl skill to get more out of the effect.",2018-11-28 09:50:49,1

Mining & Smithing Rework,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9wo5by/mining_smithing_beta_official_feedback_thread/,9wo5by,e9nznn2,None,"-Ore rocks look ugly. Like, gross ugly. Whoever designed them is either severely lacking in any semblance of skill whatsoever, or they were simultaneously extremely drunk and busy. Seriously, fix this. It's an eyesore. Looks like something one could make in MS Paint.

-Orichalcum or however it is spelled in this game(it is spelled differently in various other games; it is infuriating) shouldn't be in F2P areas. They can't make use of it, so move it elsewhere. Or, alternatively, remove MOST nodes and let just one remain in F2P, and allow F2P players the ability to make an Orichalcum Ore Box! They get a T60 Ore Box, but that's it as far as T60 smithables go. 

-Ceremonial swords, defenders, and trimmed armors should be upgradable, based on their respective tiers. No reason for these items to suddenly become inferior to equivalent-tier smithable gear. Especially defenders, as some are quite difficult to obtain.

-Mining xp is WAY too high. Please, cut it down. By like, 90%. PLEASE. There is no reason for Smithing to fall by the wayside like this. I mined enough Runite and Luminite to end up with 32 bars. I got a few thousand Smithing xp after making some weapons and armor, and I upgraded which is apparently a pro-xp option. Getting the ore, I got SO much more xp in Mining. When I started in the Beta, my total Smithing xp was about 1k higher than my Mining xp. This is so poorly balanced, it's baffling. I mean I get this is what the Beta is for, but holy crap, you guys have been working on this update for ages and you are still THIS far off the mark? C'mon, get it together...

-I don't like the AFK nature of the skills, especially Mining(partially for the reason stated above). Though this is more of a personal preference thing. I don't think Mining should be this AFKable, or any skill for that matter. Even Fishing makes you click once in a while. Again, personal preference.

-Why are there so many identical nodes in the same place if they never deplete? It seems silly if you ask me. Make them deplete, like trees in Woodcutting. No competition, can obtain multiple ores, but you'll have to move around a bit, and it justifies having multiple rocks of the same type near each other.

-I LOVE the idea of the Ore Box. I didn't make one, myself. Not much point going through all the trouble when I just wanted to test out Runite mining and smithing stuff. I'll make one when this goes live for sure! Eat your heart out, coal bag!

-While Smithing gives pitiful xp compared to Mining, it is a LOT more fun than it used to be. The added click to re-heat isn't enough to satisfy me, but it is a step in the right direction.",2018-11-14 05:54:29,1

-Right-clicking a Huge plated rune salvage says its High Alchemy value is 1 gp. I was expecting it to say 40k since each size is 8k each (from Suity's M/S rework guide), Huge is 5 times that 8k. I can only guess this is a bug.

-Scavvo's shop and Nurmof's shop both display that the Rune pickaxe is 16k, half of what it is in the live game. Why so high? Is this intended? If it is then it's too overpriced.

-Most if not all of Scavvo's rune stuff have their selling value the same as the live game, this one seems more of an oversight and has not been addressed yet. The same goes for Oziarch's Rune Platebody in Edgeville. Why is it 41k? It's value in general post rework is a lot cheaper than that. Is this intended, too?

-Not a big deal but Shooting Stars seem to never appear in the beta, even if the timer finishes after 00:00, so it's currently impossible to test how stars function post rework. 

-EDIT: Just discovered you can take your pickaxe/hatchet out of your toolbelt in the beta, but not in live game. Is it possible that this can be implemented before the rework happens?

Smithing will be a bit less profitable most likely, but it seems to be just as fast XP as it always was, which is good, and the mechanics are a lot more engaging.  

Mining looks to be better, which is great because I hate the current best method of mining; collect rocks just to throw them back on the ground in Menaphos for hours upon hours. 

That said, I have two major concerns.

I'm not sure what the idea is for Salvage.  This is really going to hurt smithing as a potential money maker since most smithed items get alched or disassembled.  These will be dropped in massive quantities and thus will probably be a lot cheaper than their ""equivalent"" smithed item.  Meaning that the market for smithed items will only be those wanting to use them, which is a much smaller market.  Smaller demand = lower prices = smithing is unprofitable. You'll be shrinking the supply, but since these are substitute goods for the most common use, that will not matter.

 
Elder Rune weapons claim to be t90, but have t80 stats.  t85 at +5.  This is FAR worse than even Bane which easily beats the t75 SGS at damage and accuracy at +3 and +4.  SGS is still probably a better weapon due to its passives, but that's fine.  Elder Rune weapons don't seem to have much of a purpose.  ",2018-11-14 01:25:56,0

the armor spikes are great! they're a high lvl smithing item that improves pvm in the same way that overloads do. they're more than enough, and they add value to existing content and items rather than detract. in the mean time, elder rune items ruin ripper claws, attuned crystal, and fury blades (which are already pitiful value).",2018-11-14 06:49:12,0

As someone who prides themselves in self sufficiency and enjoys the role play aspect of making their own gear I can finally do this without worry of wasting an exponential amount of time (leveling to 85 mining for runite, leveling to 99 smithing for rune platebody..) I am unsure of how this will effect the market but I believe this could truly bring a lot of people together to play this great game and enjoy the many features it has to offer. I was skeptical of the afk gains at first but after playing it a bit and thinking on it, I realized that leveling can be a serious chore and that definitely takes away from the game! I am thankful for this change because it has free'd me up to do my own household chores and also play other hands-off/low maintenance types of games with little worry. Though I did read that there would be exp gains for paying attention (I believe this was apparent with smithing, though idk if this is true for overall gains or just speed, but with mining the only new thing I could do was prospect an ore which seemed like a more thorough examine - I expected, or imagined, an intuitive game for the actual mining effort). As a returning player from the mid 2000s era it is amazing to see the game hit new highs! I am very eager to make my own metal sets and prepare for wilderness pk as well as the other fun minigames! I am very curious as to when the mining and smithing beta will hit live realms as that's what I anticipated with this trial run period - a little disappointed that this wasn't the case, please let us know [Jagex] when you expect this to be up and running!",2018-11-13 22:01:02,-1

Couple of Issues
-Is ore in the wildy gonna give better XP because of the dangers of being in the wildy, if not they might as well be removed because there are other locations of the ore not in the wildy.

-Rockitunities is hard to spot in the Desert (light animica ore)

-Masterwork Armour is OP against most bosses in the GWD1

-Was there New types of Crossbows/Longbows/Shieldbows to go with the new bars in M&S Beta?

Suggestions
-Updated Auto Smither, scalable at players mining/smithing level

-Tiered Hammers, that help smithing speed/rate a bit

-Remove Deposit-Ore/Bars from the Anvil",2018-12-03 07:51:55,-1

I feel as if it would be more appropriate to make this at the dragon forge, just like the dragon platebody. 

If you look at the silly pickaxe it has aspects of all 3 items, the handle IS the blast forge hammer, with the added imcando parts, and with a crystal head on top. I'm more upset that it has the exact same stats as a smithed +5 elder rune pick. Its only upside is augmentation. It should really get a passive of some sort or higher damage/critical numbers. 

Jagex says they want to save the value of dragon pickaxe, but a lot of people are just going to take the 100kish +5 elder rune over the currently 20mil same tool with the same stats. I know if i didn't a;ready have the parts I would even bother. Even with honing 5 you dont really get 10% because it stacks additively with magic golem, ring of whispers, lava golem and mining cape.

I do want them to avoid what happened ages ago where Bronze and Iron did pretty much the same exact thing and there was almost no reason to upgrade to Iron when you'd be using, I believe it was Steel, in a few levels. Early game matters way less these days, especially with how fast you ditch Bronze, but still. I want each tier above the next to feel like you've actually upgraded you equipment set. Also Bronze is technically like the bare minimum and should be just a little better than attacking with your fist imo. The numbers should match up to using Air Strike or Bronze Arrows with a regular Bow with the same levels. That's how I would balance it. Progression is a little weird, but thankfully Ranged also uses the same metal progression as Melee with their arrows and bolts (this is indirectly going to affect Fletching as well I presume, haven't seen much talk about that, are there not Necromium Arrows, etc?).

&#x200B;

With the rework, these skill look like they will be not only easier and more accessible, but also more rewarding. If you were to consider mining and smithing to be high reward, you would want it to at least be moderately risky. Even though I myself am not fond of wilderness activities, I view the value in choosing to put some of these ores out there, in the same way that I view aggressive mobs near mining nodes to be important. If you choose to take the path of least requirement, then there should be a risk.  


This is counteracted by the fact that certain quest completions and skill thresholds completely remove both of those issues from the table. At max skills and all quests done, I have access to all ores without needing to enter the wilderness. This is a reward for completing more of the game's content than I initially need to mine the ores themselves. While opinions differ on the topic, the fact remains that very few aspects of this game reward a ""pure"" play style, and this includes broad archetypes like ""skiller"" and ""Combat pure"". **To get the most out of the game, you need to play most aspects of it.**

&#x200B;

in fact, most of the criticism above doesn't apply to people who play long term, but in that I feel it highlights a different issue. New players may be deterred by this approach, **and that is supremely good.** So now you're probably confused. Why would deterring new players be good? Well inherently it is bad, but if you cater exclusively to new players, it develops a culture where everything should be easy. NO! Players should learn early on that not all content is easy, or convenient, or free for that matter. I get that the f2p addy issue might seem like a paywall, but if all of the best and most convenient methods were free, then nobody would pay for the game!  


Since I ended up addressing most of the other points I might as well add that i'n not exactly bothered by the textures of the rock, although I'm unsure what they look like in lower detail, I will agree that the larger models obscure rockertunities, and any changes that will improve visual clarity in both rocks, and armor and always a positive!

Mining & Smithing Rework,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9wo5by/mining_smithing_beta_official_feedback_thread/,9wo5by,e9q9yep,mrdoomydoom,">Bane looks to be the strongest known metal of the 2nd age and the metal used by Zaros' army primially.

Lore-wise making Bane a main-line armor tier is just so terrible. But 2nd age, supposedly, the stuff was super-unknown. Even now it's supposed to be you only rediscover it because [Events of RotM go here]. But screw continuity i guess.

>So is Barrows armor Necrite with gold instead of Phantasmite? Phantasmite seems like it would be unavailable and unknown at the time. Colors seem to line up and it requires gold coinage to repair. So maybe it is made of Necrite that has been saturated with gold? Like a tooth filling.

If anything it seems more like it'd be made of just Phasmatite. Not sure where you're getting 'gold' from, but Phasmatite iirc is ""Shadow Realm fuckery happened here"" - e.g. Sliske rippin holes in reality everywhere. Plus, Sliske made Barrows armor, so.

Pretty sure Torva's just regular armor (elder rune?) ""enchanted"" with distilled 2nd age warrior-brand badass.

>Is Runite a ceramic? Its a sedimentary rock that gets melted down with another sedimentary rock. No telling what is in there, but it appears to be stronger than steel when hit, but it can oxidize. Same question for Mithril and Adamant. I'd imagine Adamant is made of crushed up gems.

You're acting like Jagex are metallurgists. They are not. Also, canonically, runite is actually pretty soft, but it has a magic forcefield on it that makes it better than other metals. Also also, luminite is used a la coal, to heat up the furnace hot enough to work it. Also also also, where tf are you getting ""sedimentary"" from, there's no reason to assume that.

Dark Animica is congealed ""dark"" elder god-energy, light is ""light"". On Gielinor it's where Zaros and Seren hung out, cause that's what they're made of.

........What I'm saying is that's a lump of dried up seren/zaros sweat you're holding there buddy.

Also, I don't know what ""Dealyte"" is, because that's not a thing. Did you mean ""daeyalt?"" If so, it's a chemically reactive thingamabob that makes blood do neato things, hence vampyric experiments.

This is kinda the problem though; the dragons that are weak enough to melee, or weak enough in general, that you don't miss the accuracy loss are generally the ones too weak to be bothering with by the time you have the 80 attack needed to wield the swords.

&#x200B;

In hindsight, Rune dragons were maybe a poor example because of their inherent anti-melee mechanic anyway, but what other dragons do you have that you are likely to kill at 80-99 Attack? QBD, maybe celestial, gemstone dragons and ED2 dragons. All of those are going to be splashscape central. 

&#x200B;

I think I'd rather the swords had some sort of passive that treated dragons' affinity as 90 (ie always weak to them) similar to darklight, if need be with either reduced base stats or a reduced damage bonus.

Throughout lower tier ores it’s unlikely a new player will encounter another new player who knows about this (unless s/he’s watched their favourite YouTuber, or properly read wiki?), and even if s/he does we’re now somewhat reliant on the person in the the know up conversation with “so if you click...”

The appeal of the game world being able to tell me everything I need to know to succeed is great, I shouldn’t have to tab out of the game to read up on if I’m doing something right, or happen upon a friendly player who will take a gambit on me not knowing about a mechanic.

Mining & Smithing Rework,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/9wo5by/mining_smithing_beta_official_feedback_thread/,9wo5by,e9zgile,ImRubic,"So a few things I'd like to comment on.

Regarding the Wilderness/Aggressive mobs, these comments were directed at the primary skilling hubs. Jagex wants to create social hubs where people skill together. My point here is that these skilling hubs shouldn't be involved with those points. I agree you can add better rewards or unique benefits to other locations to make them more rewarding though.

Next, the wilderness is meant to be a dangerous pvp zone. However in recent years there has been a strong push to make it a pure Pking zone. Pking doesn't entice healthy PvP. Therefore orienting mining benefits with the goal of getting players to skill in the wilderness in order to create PvP is a BAD idea.

Finally, F2P is meant to be a separate game, not a Demo. You are suggesting a demo. Demo's aren't good for subscription based games. That's because the goal of a demo is to get you to buy the game, and once you have it, you have it for good. In Runescape if your membership lapses it's usually for a reason. So being punished by being limited to do a demo just pushes players away versus a full game where they continue to play and eventually get membership again.

I think lore is intact actually. Rune was strongest human known metal, then dragon started showing up. They got kinda an idea of what it was made of and experimented with partial success. Then barrows/necrite/phamtasmite. This stuff is later in lore. I'd imagine necrite is a sixth age innovation? Bane ore is found an area that was controlled by Zaros for a long time. Torva's gear is tier 80 like Bane. All of Zaros' stuff is purple as if made from the stuff.

Im getting sedimentary from the type of geodes you find. 

Anima is really rare, and its locations are specific. The Zaros one makes sense in that it could ""just be sweat"", but I think it might actually be blood. Nothing important is going on at the Light Anima location. They are just in the boonies of the Empires of they controlled. There are not even ruins around.

And as far as f2p goes, it's the same game as p2p minus most of the content and you don't have to pay for it. That's by definition a demo, or trial. They are not 2 different games. If f2p could do everything p2p could do, and could do it as easily as p2p, there would be no reason to pay for membership.

So here is the plain solution, If you don't want to mine ore in the wild, then do the quests and skills that open up other ores. If you don't want aggressive mobs to attack you in skilling hubs then level your combat up, if  you want alternative training methods that aren't available in free to play areas, then play enough to buy a bond with gp.

Ultimately the effort:profit ratio in mining will reach a point of equilibrium - irregardless of the starting point for ores. If mining isn't profitable enough for the effort being put in - less players will mine, maybe they will harvest divine charges instead for example. With less mining, less ores would be entering the game, resulting in surplus ores being consumed. Once surplus ores are consumed, prices should rise in relation to demand. 

Additionally, giving additional ores based on the old effort vs the new would only impact up to t50 ores. The new ores would still hold a market of their own. 

If this solution still seems risky, potentially develop an idea regarding the current value of ores and compensate accounts based on the number of ores they have based on the projected new value/ease of access. e.g. runite is currently 10k, the rework will make it 100% easier to collect. New projected value is therefore 5k. Players with rune ore will be given 5k per ore as compensation. The limitation of this strategy is that projection of prices is a grey area and would be difficult to accurately gauge. 

Better yet, it may be easier to give players the option to either liquidate rune/addy/mithril/etc ores for a nominal value, or convert them into the reworked ores. This would involve transforming current ores into an unusable item for this purpose. Once the ores/bars are in their unusable form, they could be given a sell to store value that correlates with their current price (and unable to be alched if needed) 

Simultaneously there should be a temporary means of irreversibly converting the ores/bars into the reworked usable resources (Time-frame should be around the 3-6 month mark, a substantial amount of time for the market to settle) After the 3-6 month period, all unconverted ores/bars should then be locked to the unusable form - only being able to be sold to stores for the assigned price. (either that or simply automatically converted to gp)

The benefits of this method allows players the flexibility to choose to keep their resources or liquidate them (helpful for ironmen, in which resources are often sought after, rather than gp). Additionally it sets a temporary safety net on the market, as old ores placed into the market wouldn't impact the prices of the newly tiered ores, outside of temporarily standardising prices - whilst old materials are converted into either gold, or the new materials. 
E.g. reworked runite would be unlikely to initially rise above 12k due to that being the current value of the non-reworked ore - 12k being the subsequent sell to store value for the old runite ore.

I think maybe converting them into untradeable ores/bars that retain atleast the xp value or something. E.g. the Runite ores in my bank are worth around 300-340k xp per 100 runite with challenges. That alone is roughly 25m xp with my brawlers I would lose out on.

Tbh I have no idea what the perfect solution would be, but doing nothing I feel like is worse than giving us something for the ores we currently have. I will admit I don't care much about the economy as an ironman, but I feel like getting nothing but a straight nerf to these ores is too harsh.

Runite and addy bars are often used as summ supplies for blue charms and that is a hit we could prob take. But ores are super valueable for us. 

I would highly suggest talking with the high lvl ironman clans like Iron gods and hear their suggestions. From what I have seen, it looks like a major nerf is coming and everybody is rushing to avoid dealing with the update. ",2018-11-14 12:21:46,3

I did some research about the skillcape, and Jagex has the following metric: ""Though there were a few mentions of the current perk being useful, it is actually one of the last used with only around 60 people using it a day."" That's hardly a meta. I also fail to see how a cape perk that automatically lights a fire for you creates a meta for cooking training. Permanent fires, Prif fires, and ranges exist.  

But I digress. Overall, it does improve the skills. It makes them worthwhile to train and makes them the primary way to obtain ore and make metal items, while making those valuable as well. That comes at the price of making smithing harder for irons by making them need to obtain more ore than for 99. 

The rework fails if mining is still pointless afterwards. Making ore valuable makes mining useful and a good skill. This means ore needs to be more scarce, or used en masse.

Does this shaft irons? Yes. But it's necessary for a successful rework. That is unfortunate, but we shouldn't make the skills useless to cater to a specialized game mode. It'll make smithing more useful to irons at least, since they can easily get better armor themselves compared to before. 

There are a few suggestions that could help irons but stay in the spirit of the rework. Perhaps burial armor or the state previous to it could be sold by NPCs for a high price, and everything would be untradable. Or you could burn excess ore just for XP at the blast furnace in a high intensity method that would be unattractive unless you had a ton of ore, which would benefit irons. Instead of just complaining, think of constructive criticism they could use. This is an ever evolving game. Methods will be nerfed or buffed over time. Suggest ways to mitigate that without killing an update or just whining. 

Finally, this update is truly in the spirit of Ironman mode, and makes me want to start one. It heavily emphasizes DIY for mining and smithing and rewards you for it. It provides a path for progression without RNG at bosses. And you get ore to make things far quicker than before.

If an update favoring the spirit of Ironman mode  but making the mode harder is unpalatable to you, perhaps you should consider that you're playing the mode to say BTW and for prestige, not for the actual reason it's there. Which is fine, but you really shouldn't be complaining in that case.",2018-11-14 22:54:27,5

Does tank armor truly have *no* value, as in, T50-fremennik-power-armour-is-better-than-Achto no value? Has anyone actually done a full comparison of the two, like going off to GWD2 or somewhere and comparing kill count and resource usage? Power armor (specifically head/torso/legs/boots/gloves, not including jewelry and capes since there's no real ""tank"" option there) might give you a, say, +70 damage bonus, but that's 70 added to like, 1800, which is around 4%. Meanwhile tank gear will have a damage reduction of 7-8% before you even factor in the superior armour rating.

I'd agree that in the case where you're taking no or negligible damage, power armour is the better choice to get faster kills/XP, but when damage taken and resource usage is a thing that matters, I've yet to see evidence to convince me that tank gear is *never* a viable option.",2018-11-14 03:02:30,1

A player made fire gives a 10% xp buff to your cooking. So when using the firemaking cape, you would get an elder log fire, which could be keybound and saved you from having to withdraw a log to light yourself. So the meta is now to have an alt account lighting the fire for you. That is on jagex, blame them. There is no reason why the cape couldn't retain its log fire perk. As to why only 60 players used it per day. Do you honestly think players don't cook in bulk? Most are gonna cook a few thousands pieces of food then use them first. Not a lot use it everyday or have the 99 fm cape early.

To your point of using an alt account, jagex doesn't care. If they did, they would not have allowed us to group for low lvl bossing. Let me tell you why that wont change. That is because our very own Ironman curator, Mod Ramen, abused the system himself to leech bosses for armour, on his hcim at the time. I agree we shouldn't have to use alts for the best methods, maybe tell that to jagex.

I agree that the direction would be in spirit with the gamemode, but the reality is that the balancing seems off. I have already spoken with Mod Jack about suggestions, because we are both not happy with players, like me, basically losing out of huge amounts of xp, from our banked resources. We are basically told atm to use them or lose them. Take a look at my [resources.](https://puu.sh/C1Cxh/08ca33800e.jpg) It would take 78 days to deplete that much runite with dailies, not to mention I would have to spend a lot of time with using my addy ores as well. 

I don't currently have much time to play and I am trying out osrs atm, so I will basically lose out on my xp, because I don't intend to play the next two months. 

My final say in this, is that I would like to see atleast our banked ores not be completely useless after the update (atleast compared to now). Btw ironmen can't access blast furnace.

Say a boss takes x time to kill with no bonuses/gear, t80 wep, lv90 Magic, lv80 Defence. These are reasonable stats where someone really camp a boss yet, say no turm/ss/ovls, and more importantly the stats where many irons will start camping gwd1 for t70. As such, they'll use t60 power (lunar) instead of t50 (fremmy) because it's available and better.

With t80 tank armor:

>Time to kill: x

>Damage reduction: 8% armour + 8% Defence level = 16%

>Damage taken: (1-0.16)x = 0.84x

With t60 power armor:

>Damage gain: 72 style bonus x 1.5 = 108 bonus. Base damage is 1489.5 (+108 bonus) = 1597.5. (1597.5/1489.5) = 7.2% damage boost.

>Time to kill: (1-0.072)x = 0.928x

>Damage reduction: 8% Defence level

>Damage taken: (1-0.08) * 0.928x = 0.8534x

The difference in damage taken is only 1.6%, which will basically never be enough to secure an additional kill. Furthermore, more ability damage might allow for a kill to happen one full threshold sooner, which saves even more time. At the worst, you'll get the same number of kills per trip for maybe one more piece of food with power armor, but at best you'll be able to get more kph *and* potentially more kills/trip by being able to speed up kills with fewer thresholds needed & save food.

Once you can start camping a boss, though, or have soul split, all of this goes out the window and power armour becomes the best choice with very few exceptions.",2018-11-14 03:53:09,1

If your affinity going in is 55 (which it would be if you are using mage), that means you'd only need an armour rating of 2371 * (55/100) = 1304 before he would start missing you. Even wearing full lunars at 70 Defence would get you there (1375 Armour) so T80 tank armour should certainly make a difference.",2018-11-14 04:46:16,1

Accuracy against t80 tank: 2370 * (55/100) / 2180 = ~59.7% accuracy

Accuracy against t60 power: 2370 * (55/100) / 1470 = ~88.7% accuracy

So yeah, I guess it would make a pretty big difference, at least pre-SS and whatnot, ~33% less damage taken. TIL

I'd say that the pick is situational, then. If you can only do like 2 kills/trip and the tank helps you pull out a third kill, go for it. If you can basically camp the boss already (DKs, Mole, whatever) thanks to taking little damage in the first place, vamp aura, ss, etc., then use power armor. At least the armor has more use than I had been lead to believe, and that would explain why my main had an easier time at zammy using a WP set than I have had recently with lunar.",2018-11-14 04:59:01,1

> 
> This week is all about getting your hands dirty. Slaying dragons may be what the fine folk at the Flying Horse Inn are gossiping about, but raising dragons is the calling of the truly bold. So bring not your armour and your sword – it’s time to grab some dirty overalls and a mucking fork and get stuck into the wonderful world of farming!
> 
> Player Owned Farm is a brand new way to work on your Farming Skill, and was one of the most sought after requests from the community Build-a-Backlog poll. The update comes courtesy of the Judges team, with frequent help and direction from the RuneScape community who spent many hours nattering away with Mod Raven and Mod Rowley in the RuneScape Player Owned Farm Discord channel.
> 
> The community has been so involved in the shaping of such a large chunk of this content drop – so a massive, very horticultural ‘thank you’ to everyone who took the time to help us shape Player Owned Farm!
> 
> ###Requirements
> 
> Those wishing to brave the world of tillage and animal husbandry will need:
> 
> * 17 Farming
> * 20 Construction
> * Access to the Ardougne LodeStone
> * RuneScape Membership
> 
> ###Starting Off
> 
> Once you arrive, head over to dear old Granny Potterington and she’ll run you through the basics of getting your farm up and running. Once you have completed the tutorial you'll start by farming rabbits, before working your way up through a range of species… and yes, those who put in the hard toil will indeed be able to farm dragons!
> 
> ###And on that farm I had a...
> 
> So you're probably wondering, how do I get animals for my farm? Well, you can get animals from your farm by:
> 
> * Hunting
> * Summoning
> * Farming Mushrooms
> * Killing Animals
> 
> (All of the above result in you murdering the parent and stealing their offspring - you utter, cruel, monster.)
> 
> * However, you can also buy some animals from Granny should you prefer. (Which is most definitely the nicer option... you're a nice person, right?)
> 
> Once you have your animals, here’s a few pointers on how the farm operates:
> 
> * There are four different pens: small, medium, large and the breeding pen - it's here that you can make lots of babies and try and create the perfect breed.
> 
> * Breeding new animals can result in different perks and traits, and bred animals can even have multiple stackable traits. For example, a bred animal may be less susceptible to disease, or instead return greater than normal XP. Some may have a higher potential to poo gold – yes, you heard us correctly.
> 
> * As your animal grows, you'll be able to gather XP and farming materials from it.
> 
> * There’s also the chance of producing an ultra-rare shiny version of an animal! However, because Mod Raven worked on this farm, you may also find yourself birthing an evil animal. Because of course he would make that possible...
> 
> ###Mucking Out - a new way to get compost!
> 
> Everybody poos and your new farm animals are no exception. Luckily there's a silver lining to the animals' tendency to distribute their produce far and wide - you can use this as a training method to help you get more farming XP!
> 
> With the poo itself you can make standard compost. Plus, if you're lucky enough to have a dragon on your farm, you can use dragon muck to create the all-new Ultra Compost.
> 
> ###Rewards
> 
> Rewards you ask? Of course there are a ""shed-load"" of rewards, as if owning your own farm wasn't a reward enough?
> 
> * Standard and Ultra Compost
> * All new Skilling Potions! (starting from standard, and working up to extremes) - secondary items are gained from gathering from the animals.
> 
> The Skilling Potions skills are: Divination, Hunter, Invention and RuneCrafting
> 
> * There is also the brand new ‘Elite Farmers Outfit’. This is the first Elite Skilling Outfit that is not from Treasure Hunter and is gained in-game. Whoop!
> 
> ###Premier Club Pays
> 
> All Gold Premier Club Members can claim a chest from the Grand Exchange, inside which they will find an all new surprise! (and if you’ve been paying attention you may just know what that is…)",2018-09-03 13:03:11,13

It isn't something I would choose to do, but people do all sorts of weird things. I've seen as many complaints that there should never be any amnesties for comp reqs as I have for the opposite. 

I'm more inclined to side with the comp cape argument from players who enjoy obtaining comp reqs for the sake of it over those who only do it to get back the BIS cape, but we here recognise there are issues surrounding comp that need to be resolved, and that ideally we should cater to both groups if possible. 

Comp cape is a bigger issue than a single update, though, and it just needs someone to prioritise it so it can get sorted. Realistically, though, compers are a small proportion of the entire player base, so it's just one of those things that takes time and effort to justify doing over updates that give greater benefit to a wider range of players.",2018-09-03 18:56:41,2

Hi  /u/jagexrowley, I understand 4 spaces is plenty but 4 spaces is not fun :( I am enjoying trying to get new animals just to read the text and traits. I want to experiment and try things... but unless I'm on just as they bread it will take a long time.

​

With so few ways to earn more beans (So far its just been a rabbit seller) and only 2 animals breeding at once. It feels like I won't be able to spend as much time here as I want too... I think some of us wanted this to be more than just another way to get a little more xp, but wanted it to be a kind of game within itself.

An extra breeding pen would add a bit more fun... and allow us to plan better what animals to keep for breeding.

Right now I see no need to keep more than the 2 of each best animal..... Apart from selling when the right trader shows up.

​

I wish there was another way to earn beans, and I don't mean ""thousands"" I mean just another way. Perhaps allow us to run an errand for grannt to another farm like the one in south falador or one near lumbridge?

I do like that it's a brand new way to train Farming, and has synergy with other skills. Like how you can be hunting chinchompas for money, and now you get an extra chompa baby to sell or use. However, I don't like that it now feels pretty much pointless to do tree runs unless you're trying to rush out levels on the skill. Like, you can check your farm once every 2-3 days and still get like 300k+ XP per week from it, just checking spiders, zygomites, etc. Like, even cows can just be fed flax or cabbage for... what, 10k Farming XP per day?

It just feels very unbalanced. I'm just spending like 20k a week on meat, and getting like 100k XP from my spiders. There's no real reason NOT to just keep grinding out the best animals - if you get yaks, you'll never have a reason to go back to cows. Once you get Glistening/Radiant, there's no real point in checking breeding traits anymore. The rewards are all permanent unlocks that aren't particularly useful, I don't think, like the seed collector and outfit... I would've preferred to see more consumable rewards, and make the permanent rewards FAR more expensive.

I also just... expected to be putting in a lot more work. Like, I expected it to be more like my kingdom - you can ignore it for a few days or weeks, but you get better rewards if you check it every day. I expected breeding to be a very small part of it, because right now, we're just ""flipping"" animals - your breeding pair will breed forever, and you're selling the kids as fast as you can. I thought we would actually be using the animal products, like, making artisanal cheese, mayonnaise, cloth from the low animals, and raising dragons, spiders and zygomites for their magical uses or to sell to the highest bidder.

It feels like they focused way too much on the breeding and the perks, and not enough on the logistics. They didn't take into account the bank space issues, not offering any kind of animal storage. All the animal products, like buckets of milk and sheep wool, are completely useless on the farm. And by the time you get those items, like getting a bucket of milk at level 50 Farming, it's not useful anymore. By the time you're level 50 in all stats, you're not making cheese or spinning wool for XP or profit. The totem perks are just... bad. A lot of the rewards and intricacies of the farm just feel tacked on, rather than features planned from the start.

Essentially, it feels just like Safecracking to me. It made the skill much faster and better for the level 50-90 gap, and it has... one or two useful rewards, sort of, but overall it just feels like free XP for little effort. Like how people used to chop willows for XP and had to drop/bank them, then ivy came out and it got easier for no real trade-off. It feels like that.",2018-11-29 07:33:37,1

Sure the strength xp is decent but 4 hours is way too long and you should get farm xp *as well* as Strength for harvesting them, just as you get farm xp *and* agility from barberries.

It's also totally bogus that calquat only gives 12k xp for harvesting, whereas zygomites which have similar level req give double that in the same period of time, *and* you can farm 12 zygomites at once instead of 1, *and* the calquat can die whereas zygomites can't.

People aren't going to bother checking the farm every day just to get max beans, because worst case scenario they just get baller xp *and* can still sell for beans. Sure it will take longer to build up beans, but they're getting xp to compensate and ultimately the beans are still rolling in.

*I* check the farm every day, but not to optimise beans. I'm checking it to optimise dragon poo rates, but I don't think I'm in a majority there either.

As for the totems, I keep 2 elder rabbits around specifically for their totem perk (which hilariously doesn't require that you feed or in any way care for them), and the dragon one is pretty sweet as well imo.

The forums were going insane with people; 1 - Telling everyone where the survey was hidden (it wasn't exactly clear in beta); 2 - Telling people to get on the beta and vote; 3 - Encouraging them to vote negatively.

I know a lot of people who were fine or liked EOC that didn't vote in the poll because they didn't think it was a big deal and they just wanted to keep playing the game.

It's a very common occurance that people who are aggrieved are overreprisented in voluntary samples... because those people have all the more motivation to voice their complaints.

The fact is that the opinions of any social network are going to be overreprisentative of people who are angry, upset or complaining. Just look at the blizzard forums, it's always complaints about everything.

If you're only looking at forums or social discussion sites then you might be surprised to see how positive the response is (despite being biased towards negative responses). But that is because you're looking only at the angry vocal minority.

Then the only answers would be ""yes,"" ""no,"" and ""it needs improvement before launch."" None of this, ""I like both"" or ""I'm not sure"" that's messing up my beautiful statistics.

Also, I'd interpret this poll as 46% of people like it (with over half of those randomly saying that they also like the old system, which has almost nothing to do with the question.) Only 20% definitely want to see it launched. 34% don't think it should be launched yet. And another 20% are too wishy-washy to even know what they want. How can anyone launch something with these statistics? These seem atrociously bad to me. Even if 80% of the people end up liking it, how can you be happy with losing 20% of your players?

That said, I agree with the statistics part.

I feel your pain. I am, in a word, indifferent to the EoC. I just dislike the mindless drivel of ""DAE EOC?"" My only intent was to inspire some discussion, though that seems to only garner me downvotes in this subreddit, unfortunately. But, I digress.

That is a fairly close poll for only 17k people  

Given that it is a binary essentially, though, I would say over 56% of them potentially outright quitting for it is rather large. But, you are correct that it may be biased in sampling, I must admit. Though, I think that the amount they said are not ok with the EoC is rather lower, given than you actually had to play through the EoC. I say this because, to say anyone absolutely needs to try something before they are able to form an opinion on it, educated or otherwise, is not true. As a poor analogy, I do not eat poop, though I know I would not like it and therefor will not try it ever. It is perfectly reasonable, no one would say, ""well you haven't eaten poop, so you can't have an opinion on it."" It is thus I would say that in relative terms tot he EoC, by excluding that group, the ""no response"" group, or even the players who simply outright dislike the EoC for what it symbolizes, or perhaps even slightly more read players they have effectively skewed the numbers. In this case, that skew would create a potentially more favorable outlook on the update than actually is there. The same can be said of silentc0re's video. I would say that relying simply on either of them is foolish, too optimistic to rely on Jagex's, and too pessimistic (bleak? Perhaps?) to rely on siltenc0re's. Thus, I would say that *if* Jagex' poll was better, it was only marginally so, because they have excluded a great deal of people who are playing currently (or what I would assume to be, given the huge size difference in percent of ""yes"" vs ""no"" indicated by the Jagex v Silentc0re videos which would make that a logically justifiable conclusion).",2012-11-09 22:53:12,2

3) Any new plans to celebrate this new bot banning?  Last time we had double loot and the Slay day, anything unique this time?

4) Without giving out much detail on future plans, what is your ideal image of Runescape in the next few years?

5) Is there anything you really want to implement into Runescape, but with the current system and EoC it's still not possible?

If something comes up such as a family loss, the need to put in a lot of studying for finals, or just the need to take a breather from Runescape, a player should be able to ""park"" their accounts. While the accounts are parked, their membership days will not count down, but they will also not be able to access the game past the lobby(or even login? It's jagex's choice). Also, the player could be able to specify the amount of days before parking, say a week. ",2012-09-24 16:46:42,3

I don't see it as a kiddy game but I know other players and non-players leads towards that perception. (This probably has something to do with the fact that we played as kids and have grown up since. I'm 21, have played since about 04/05).

As such, they don't really set much of a limit at all.

In truth, alching has much more of an effect than stores.  Dragon weapons are the go-to example: they're far more expensive in stores and only worth something because of their alch price.",2012-10-26 10:00:58,1
