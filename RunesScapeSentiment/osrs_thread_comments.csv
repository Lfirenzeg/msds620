On the one hand, Forestry aims to create a more social woodcutting experience. It does this by increasing woodcutting rates when chopping the same tree together, and putting the tree on a timer instead of a fixed number of logs.

On the other hand, the idea seems to want to push players into the forests of the Runescape game world again. However, as you still generally want to bank the logs, most people want to stick close to a bank.

The fact that a cut-timer is put on each tree means that players can group together and chop trees near a bank together, without much incentive to truly head into the forest. They just need to cycle between trees as a group. If they co-ordinate well, this could even mean they have to cycle between fewer trees then we currently have to do in game.

Perhaps then, the *respawn*-timers for trees should be increased, so you have to move into the rest of the forest. This was not an option before, because it would create resource scarcity. However, as you can now chop trees together, this may now be a viable method of diversifying the locations in which players train woodcutting. Rewards and forestry events could be tweaked to compensate for fewer banking opportunities (the log basket, leprechaun event and dryad event already are a great start to this)",2023-02-08 18:29:47,134

No competition for trees, and some random events to break up the monotony, so it'd be more social but still not that different from normal woodcutting.

But to me, especially given the theming, the ""fantasy"" feels like it should also encourage going out and exploring the roads less traveled. When one spawns, maybe you'd need to track them down first somehow? Or if that's too minigame or shooting stars-esque, maybe more 'isolated' areas have a higher chance to spawn them? You'd still have hotspots of players, but those hotspots would be a choice between proximity to a bank or maximizing mighty tree chance.",2023-02-08 18:23:15,13

 * Please don't bring back what we had pre-EoC with bonfires where you'd throw five logs on every time you headed out on a bossing trip for a HP boost - it's not fun having to remember to light a fire before a trip for a combat boost, yet if it exists, people will feel the need to do it to remain competitive. If you're desperate for a combat buff, perhaps tie in into being in the vicinity of a fire, and enable you to light one + keep it running with stackable wood (anima-infused bark?) whilst in the boss/slayer area.
 * Please make sure 2h axes require standard axes to be created (especially for dragon/crystal/infernal).
 * Having an option to use either logs or anima-infused bark for a currency seems weird - what's the point of a brand new currency if we can just buy logs and use them instead?",2023-02-09 01:52:44,17
Forestry,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/10x3kuy/forestry_the_way_of_the_forester_overview/,10x3kuy,j7q2lhj,None,"Is it unreasonable to request that 2H axes give more logs per successful chop? Something that I think other players might agree with is that gathering logs from actually cutting trees is probably one of the worst ways to actually obtain logs. It’s much better to obtain them via PvM drops or even Kingdom of Misc.


I think that it would be huge to be able to actually get way more logs per hour from actually woodcutting with an axe, and a 2H axe seems like a great way to do that.


Make the amount of logs scale with the tier of axe. For example:

Bronze 2H axe: up to 1 additional log per successful cut (2 logs)

Iron: up to 2 additional logs (3 logs total)

Steel: up to 3 additional logs (4 total) 

Scaling up to a crystal 2H axe which requires crystal charges like all crystal equipment, but gives up to 7 additional logs per cut.


There shouldn’t be any additional experience per log cut. So if you cut 8 magic logs with a crystal axe, you would only get the xp for 1 magic log. The point is to give a reasonable alternative to obtain logs in mass as opposed to pvm. The tier of axe gives a chance to give up to “x” logs, so a crystal axe could give 2 additional logs or 7 additional logs per cut.

Forestry,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/10x3kuy/forestry_the_way_of_the_forester_overview/,10x3kuy,j7uoy49,Dredge6,"I like the concept, but it needs a lot of refinement. There's a couple key areas that bother me and right now I would vote no if this was polled.

1. I think there are areas of wood cutting not touched on that are interesting and fun that should also be visited at the same time. Examples include Ents and Bird Eggs. Currently fighting Ents for log is worse than just fighting some other monsters if you specifically want logs. For being a members only monster, it really just sits forgotten most of the time. Bird eggs are another woodcutting thing that should be exciting but isn't. 1/256 chance when chopping for a nest and then a 3/100 for it to be an egg. All for 100 prayer experience (if you have access to WC guild) and a 1/1200 for a fashionscape item.  3/25,600 is rarer than some PvM drops and yet it's only worth 22 bones worth of experience and a 1/1200 at an item that doesn't help WC. 
2. The bonus for multiple people is a good idea, but doesn't fix the problem created by the WC guild. Yes, instead of everyone being at WC guild chopping trees, they will now be at the trees closest to a bank chopping away. (Which also makes some of the events they suggested like the leprechaun and run energy seem pointless) It also hurts players who play solo, which most new player will be, or players that play at weird times for their time zone. The bonus should be reworked from being how many people are chopping the tree to how long it's been since the tree respawned. Imagine if Oak Trees were now labeled as ""Oak Tree (New Growth)"", ""Oak Tree (Medium Growth)"" and ""Oak Tree (Old Growth)"". There would be no bonus for ""New Growth"", then after 1 hour it would turn into ""Medium Growth"" and gives a +3 bonus, then after 8 hours it turns into ""Old Growth"" and gives a +7 bonus. (Just example numbers, someone else is welcome to crunch numbers and tweak).  Then to continue to encourage group play, you have the despawn timer increase for each player chopping the tree. So again using Oak as an example, if the despawn timer is 60 seconds from when you start chopping, each additional player past the first would add +10% to the base despawn timer, up at a maximum of 10 additional players (so 11 in total). So if I was out solo woodcutting an Oak and I've been chopping away for 30 seconds and someone comes and joins me, the despawn timer would increase from 30 seconds left to 36 seconds left. And even if that person walks away, that extra despawn time is still kept. By doing this, woodcutting becomes more thematic, incentivizes chopping entire forests, doesn't penalize solo play, and incentivizes group play as you can spend more time talking and less time moving between trees.
3. The clothes pouch is a bad direction for the game to head into with fashionscape. Fashionscape belongs at banks, POH, and Clan Halls, not during skilling content. Forestry outfit should be a reskin of the lumberjack outfit like the spirit anglers outfit for fishing. Things like that and recolors are great for skilling/PvM, but full fashionscape doesn't belong there. 
4. Tree Leaves should only be usable on fires. Herblore has enough benefits already, it doesn't need another one. Meanwhile firemaking is a dead skill after you've made all the eternal fires. The type of leaf would require a certain level of fire making to burn on any campfire (including those made by players) and would affect all nearby players. So similar to how bars/ore are dropped in PvM, leaves could be dropped as well, because even a player who could only chop Oaks, could still burn magic leaves if their firemaking is high enough. Similar to how a player could smith rune armor even if they could only mine up to iron. The benefits from burning the leaves would also be things to incentivize group play in other activities. Imagine things like increasing superior slayer monster spawn chance, thereby giving benefit to people doing slayer tasks in the same area in single-way combat zones. Or decreasing the chance to crush semi-precious gems so people craft together. Other ideas including making monster non-aggressive, increasing run energy restoration rate or allowing run energy to restore while moving, decrease damage from skilling bosses like WT and Zalcano, or giving a chance to not consume astral, cosmic, or nature runes when casting a spell. These examples could make PvM interesting by creating situations where group non-bossing become beneficial and single-way areas become more beneficial, while also creating interesting choices as whether to use 3 inventory slots to bring a tinder box, log basket, and leaves for the extra benefit. They also making skilling interesting as now being huddled around a campfire while you fletch/craft/enchant becomes more social. Again though the important thing is a solo player can still benefit from this, but it becomes more fun and social for people working as a group. 

I'm sure I could find more stuff to go on about, but that's the general idea. Needs more polish and a closer examination on the meta game impact these changes will have.",2023-02-09 15:23:26,8

That said, I am not a fan of the group bonus. People shouldn't be forced to group-chop a tree to get optimal xp rates.     

    
This would also probably result in players going to dedicated wc locations/worlds. One aspect of current WC that I do like is that you sometimes aee players chopping away in all sorts of different places.  

  
Also this is a straight-up buff for wc xp-rates which I think isn't really needed to begin with.  
    

Not punishing players for group-chopping: Awesome.  
Rewarding players for group-chopping: Meh.

* I'm a bit disappointed by the actual activities for forestry. It effectively sounds like normal woodcutting with random events. I was hoping for something more engaging as a new activity, not chopping trees and waiting for random events.

* Could normal woodcutting be just *one* way of doing forestry? It would be great to have a more engaging activity that you can jump right into. Perhaps have the different forests of Gielinor as hotspots where these events and others could spawn, with multiple possibly active at a time and one guaranteed? These should be things like stopping wildfires, slash and burn to fertilize the ground, removing invasive species... So on. Tougher events than those currently proposed, but more rewarding. 

* The log sink feels arbitrary and also not like a big sink, especially if people are going to be chopping more logs as part of this. Right now the only sinks would be one off purchases for the log basket, forestry outfit, recolors, and 2H axes. It's kind of weird to spend logs for these, but they're also a temporary sink. After buying them, that's it. The only reward shop item that currently uses logs repeatedly is charging the Arbor gloves. The only other sinks are 1 of 10 random events and using logs for bees on a stick. 

* The rewards feel whelming, except for tea. They're primarily focused on faster training, but there's not a lot on offer as actual material rewards, like new items to make woodcutting itself more rewarding, or other skills. 

* Tea is my favorite part of this and also the best concepted idea. Only thing to say here is the actual tea effects need some changing. Guaranteed +5 boosts for every skill from teas is way too overpowered. It's nice how various pies and beers have uses as guaranteed boosts. This would kill them. Effects should be things like, ""chop roots instead of logs"" or ""empower earth spells and give them the enfeeble effect"" or ""greatly boost throwing axe capabilities"". They should differentiate themselves from potion by not just being level boosts, but instead being effects.

**TLDR**: the activity itself is disappointing, random events while woodcutting. There's no log sink aside from one-off purchases really, and that'll only give logs use and value for like a month. Rewards are largely XP focused,  but there's nothing to do with those higher levels. And teas shouldn't be level boosts, but esoteric effects. The current proposal kills all the potions, pies, and beers we currently have.",2023-02-08 23:55:46,11

Having a huge variety of events and possibilities while wc will give it so much variety and unpredictability. That will be a lot of fun. I am worried about xp rates, it says it will be higher xp/hr than redwoods but doesn't specify at 90+ wc... wc has plenty of viable methods, I would hate to see this become the only good one instead of ""A"" good one.

28 log bag seems unnecessary but whatever, and I love the idea of the clothing pouch letting you wear whatever while getting the outfit boost. Skilling outfits were a mistake to begin with, they should have all been blessings that take the same amount of time to get, and the outfits themselves should have been purely cosmetic. Making people use four slots to get an xp boost just seems totally arbitrary and unnecessary.

Maybe even make it so that the mighty trees each take a tree type, so maybe find a mighty oak tree near Varrock or Falador, but the mighty Magic/Redwood can be found in Miscellania or near Yanille? A region where you tend to find higher level content?

Why exclude the woodcutting guild from an update like this? I understand that there's already congregation there for woodcutting, but I imagined it becoming a huge bustling place full of people on specific worlds with this update. A little disappointed to hear about this.

ETA: Also, the concept of the clothes pouch adding fashionscape to woodcutting without sacrificing efficiency seems a little pointless when you immediately turn around and add a new outfit that doesn't sound like it would be able to be stored there.

Maybe I'm confused, but how many of these are things that you're locked out of before you have the particular piece of kit? and if you DONT have the kit, but someone ELSE has the kit, can you still participate in the event? It says iron players can participate even without the consumable. Does that mean you can't spawn it on your own without it but you can join in if some main spawns it? Or does that mean that these things give a higher chance of them spawning. But also, is that a weird cater to iron players where iron players can participate without the consumable? Or is it that mains can do the same but they want to clarify that irons can participate TOO? If multiple people have the consumable does it just roll ""who triggered the event"", but then anyone nearby can join? Can someone more literate than me make sense of the words more clearly?

My biggest concern is just that it will feel weird if this is supposed to inspire group play but then has weird exceptions to that where your new friends teleport away to hunt some pheasants or chill with the dryads, and you're left staring at a stump because you forgot to fill your forestry kit with multiple of each item before chilling at your favorite tree chopping spot.

I'm sure we'll all hit a critical mass of having all the items, but imagine if Hallowed Sepulchre you could only do the magic portal event until you got 100 marks, then got to unlock one other type of chest? Maybe the anima and all the subitems will be super common and this isn't a concern, but it's hard to say without the numbers.

Let me get stung by the bees while doing the smoker event or have to thwack the pheasants by hand at a slower rate if I don't have the item yet. Or make the rewards lesser without the item. Something to incentivize having the item, without making it a hard requirement.",2023-02-08 18:57:10,1

New and emergent content? Yes absolutely! But it should exist in cohesion with what was already there. Tweak experience rates as needed to keep things balanced but the way basic trees work is imo one of those osrs “staples” to me. 

Mighty trees are a really cool idea. My thoughts for them would for a group (or forest, if you will) of trees to all count towards the same mighty tree spawn. As trees in that forest are felled, the chance for a mighty tree to grow is increased. This will incentivize people to cut together, not necessarily at the same tree, and all work towards the common goal of getting that mighty. 

Sharing a basic tree will fell it faster, getting that mighty faster, but perhaps you lose out a bit on resource and xp in the meantime. But the faster you fell that forest, the faster you get to the big daddy trees!

Mighties can reward groups especially well compared to a solo go at the tree, to make up for any lost xp and resources while whacking on the juniors.

•Xp/hr and gp/hr should be equal or more than all existing methods including boring, carpal tunnel inducing 2t teaks. Otherwise why use forestry update to train wc at all?


•Buffs should be better than stews but only if they require high levels to make in the first place. Also make them have divine effect. The stew grind can be tedious at times with bad RNG.


•HP overtime tea or something like that would be cool and wouldn't replace any existing potion as far as I can tell. Make it stack with hp cape!


•I hope clothes pouch work with all skilling outfits. If not then make us grind for some drop to combine with the pouch from respective skilling bosses/minigames like tempoross for angler outfit. Or hell, sepulchre for graceful outfit! Would reduce gracefulscape heavily.


•Make respawn times really long so people would move deeper into forests and *branch* out. Otherwise there will just be meta spots that are nearest to the banks.

For those unaware: when you start to gather divination wisps in RS3 from a wisp spring, it partially fills up a ""gathering bar"" that acts as a countdown for that spot to deplete. If another person joins you at that spot, it adds to the bar (tho not as much as the initial amount). I believe it has diminishing returns so it can't go on forever.

This way, even if you join a spot/tree that someone has already started, you still get a baseline x amount of time to stay there. Not like at mining veins where it can sometimes have the issue of ""damn, I just got here but it depleted in 2 ticks because the timer from the first person ran out :("".",2023-02-08 22:52:28,1

Are campfires going to be similar to bonfires in rs3? I would really like to just throw logs on a fire rather than line firemake. (I hate wintertodt) It can even be worse xp/hr than line firemaking. In a line you can do \~1500 logs an hour, I would be ok with 1k logs an hour on a campfire.

Some Ideas for the combat teas:

* Damage mitigation. Instead of buffing defense and then players choosing between super defense pot or defense tea. damage mitigation like the jusiticiar set is useful for many situations and justiciar is difficult to get early-mid game. This could be broken out into anti-melee damage or anti-magic damage to make them more situational rather than just straight damage mitigation.
* Aggression tea. Similar to rs3's aggression pot. This would make it so I don't have to sit at crabs all day.
* Increased hp. temporary boost (1 hour?) to lvl120 hp
* Throw able teas. Like the Holy water is good against demons could we get a tea you throw at enemies to lower their defense. This shouldn't be as good as the dwh i'm thinking this is for mid game gwd before you get bgs or dwh.",2023-02-09 18:15:46,1

I lean heavily on the idea that you should be able to see your gear and the gear other players are using. The game is all about progression and having items that matter and seeing other players with items that matter is important to me.

&#x200B;

The problem is that, specifically for almost all kinds of skilling, there is a giant void. Like, what do you wear while skilling? Often, the best specific item is a measly 2.5% exp boost. Which is really nothing, so you'd often rather wear something like graceful because it has a larger effect.

&#x200B;

I've used this example before, but 'ya know how we have 10+ outfits from 40-70 ranged? Well, due to the diversity - You have items from clues, bosses, crafting and minigames - You see people wearing a bit of everything for different purposes.

Well, we have 1 outfit from 1-99 woodcutting. And the only thing lumberjack competes with is graceful. It's not even funny at low little diversity this offers at a fundamental level.

Already have 99wc so this is just for rewards for me. But the age old 3tick needs to be the fastest is okay in some ways but also not in some ways. I don’t see why there can’t be more enjoyable methods that are close to or on par with 3t. Sure I did the crappy methods. And I want my achievement to be seen that way but it doesn’t have to be by making the enjoyable methods not good xp. I just want newer players to have to put forth similar dedication towards the game that I had to. There can be a more fun method that gives rates of 2t teaks. As long as a player is putting in good effort for those rates then I’m happy. I don’t want to see a redwood style method that gives those rates.

There are what, 9 main tiers of axes? I'd say additional logs should be broken down in brackets of 3 with higher tiered axes adding extra % chance of gaining an additional log.

Ex: Bronze axe - 3% chance at 1 additional log;
      Iron - 6% chance at 1 additional log;
      Steel - 9% chance at 1 additional log;
      Black - 3% chance at 2;

Having the 2h axe give more logs, when combined with the log sack is the way. The log sack is an xp boost on it's own, the proposed 2h axe is just more of the same, longer trips -> more xp.

So imagine you're minding your business doing whatever and a fire starts somewhere in the world. Guards on top of watchtowers in nearby towns spot it and sound an alarm. Suddenly a bunch of NPCs start running around panicking and asking players for help. It's such a special thing that you'll seriously consider dropping whatever it is you're doing and rush to help.

Then you arrive to the location and start cutting down trees and brush to limit the spread of the fire.

By making this an equip item in a slot like ammo, you can make sure that it’s clear to players that this overrides things like your graceful bonus, while letting you choose an outfit and still get the skilling outfit benefits.

The other solution is something like Graceful always takes priority over skilling exp boosts, but that might be weird if someone didn’t notice they had on like the boots/gloves then found out three hours into a skilling session that they were getting -2.5% for it.

They want to release new content but are afraid of making that content have comparable rates to the unintended click intensive nonsense that only a select few masochists actually enjoy.

They’d rather make dead content because it’ll “devalue” others skill levels. They’re not devalued. They still have the skill level and they got it before the people who are using the new methods to train. There’s your value. 

Yet, they they can introduce new weapons and armors into the game that make old content easier but that somehow isn’t “devaluing” those previous achievements?

In the current state of the game, even doubling the number of logs you receive per roll would still result in woodcutting remaining vastly inferior to the existing “click boss” meta.

Take KBD as an example. Currently, KBD drops 150 noted yew logs at a rate of 1/12.8. Assuming a fairly reasonable average of [30 kills/hr](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Killing_the_King_Black_Dragon), that’s over 350 logs per hour; on task with a lance, it’s nearly 600 per hour.

Compare that to woodcutting: Even at 99 woodcutting, you can expect about [220 logs per hour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Cutting_yew_logs). Even with tick manipulation, the maximum rate is still less than the lowballed KBD estimate at 345 per hour. 

IMO, even chopping yews at level 60 woodcutting should yield more logs than KBD does, let alone 99 wc with tick manipulation. Whether that means reworking its drop table, buffing wc log rates, or a mix of both is a separate discussion. But considering that 7 additional logs would bring the yew rate from 220/hr to 1760/hr (at 99 wc and using a BIS degradable crystal axe, mind you), I don’t think it’s totally unreasonable.",2023-02-08 19:42:54,12

It's really a dangerous and terrible precedent tbh, let's take it a step further and say you can pray flick to use 0 prayer, forever. People get so good at it, they can be immune to any damage forever, do you balance around the fact people found a way to effectively have infinite prayer despite nothing being balanced *around* having infinite prayer so now the balancing concepts revolve *around* infinite prayer flicking? If a fight requires prayer flicking then anyone who doesn't know how to *or* *can't* is effectively shit out of luck, it heavily impacts and limits design space when you design around having infinite of whatever, despite the original game design not accounting for it.

Is it bug abuse? Absolutely, but at the end of the day the devs decide what is or isn't allowed.

You're right. Henceforward, exp rates should be dropped 5x across the board. You want fun? Go play RS3. We're here to grind. People have had it too easy for too long. 30k xp/hr chopping the 2nd highest tree in the game is ridiculously fast, should be 3k at the max. The content was overturned in 2002, the gaming landscape has evolved. It's unreasonable for people not to expect to spend 3,000 hours to max woodcutting, WC is all about that good good grind. You're making money, after all. 1k per log? What is this, chambers of xeric? Drop those numbers down down down, it's grinding time baby.

Can we also address MLM? Why is Jagex letting people train mining without 2t at all? Mining is about clicking for your exp. 1 click should be 1xp. Dirty casuals want to afk MLM for 450 hours to get 99? Fucking absurd. This is grindtime, baby. 3 months of treating mining as a fulltime job shouldn't get you even close to 99.

Not looking for it to be faster. I do however think updates should happen that offer similar xp rates to what we have but are more fun. A good example imo is tempoross. If you focus hard you can get pretty competitive rates there. It’s much more interactive than afk fishing and offers better rates than afk. It isn’t as intensive of an activity as 3t barb and falls just a bit below. I wouldn’t be against a method like tempoross that’s more intensive but more enjoyable and bearable than 3t barb.

Like for me I've maxed an account, learned many of those methods and can tell you that they suck and a lot of the time I went and did something else after learning. So for a lot of people they just want the actual game and gameplay to be better and dislike seeing everything shackled to certain rates from certain unenjoyable activities

Despite having already learned and spent the effort myself I would 100% be behind seeing many of those methods replaced by something better outright.

In terms of full scale transmogs, major disagree. Recognition of items is a core aspect of itemization and osrs is a game based on items. Observing other players is fundamental to an mmo, especially for newer players, as a means of unspoken feedback and familiarity. Being able to look at a player and quickly understand what they're likely doing/training is important in my opinion.

Items are iconic

~Some serve as marks of progression or achievement. Barrows gloves/quest rewards, ardy cape/diary rewards, fire/inferno cape etc. 

~ Some are activity specific. Skilling sets, tools, slayer helm/gear, prayer bonus gear, void, quest requirements, clue gear/wildy setups, etc.

~ Some inspire others. Dang that guy has bandos, I need to earn gp. Rogues outfit, oh yeah, I need to go get that. Inferno/Max cape... sick, I'm gonna get that one day.

It's enough content that every elite diary features some. I don't think XP should be balanced at getting to 99 (unless it's completely ludicrous), but it should improve as you get higher levels. Around 85 WC for instance, something intensive with magic trees should be the best XP. Unlocked at 75, full potential at 85. And it doesn't have to be even 150k/hr or something super high. 

I also disagree with the idea that it's sensible to be annoyed if there's a new skilling method that's 10k/hr XP better than the current best. That isn't going to devalue the achievement of getting a 99. Plus, as you've pointed out, there's no real reason to get 99 most of the time. Intrinsically there's no value to it. It's how you and other players look at it that gives it value.

It's important to note that once you get 99, your journey is set in stone. It doesn't matter what changes happen. How you got 99 is going to forever be how you got 99. For instance, I got 120 archeology on RS3 before you could use XP lamps, bonus XP, or MTX on it. Since when I got it, they've added content that speeds it up where the skill sucked too.

My main point was more so that within the average player’s game progression (and especially for the average Ironman, for whom collecting raw resources is a fundamental and unavoidable part of the game progression), there simply isn’t much reason at all to do something like chop yew trees for logs. Not to mention that (with respect to the KBD example) the 350 yew logs/hr is more so a side benefit to the real reward of 300K+/hr profit and the chance at a gamechanging upgrade like the dragon pickaxe. With all that put together, someone like a typical iron who for whatever reason needs a large number of yew logs is greatly disincentivized from traditional woodcutting, which really shouldn’t be the case.

I also want to reiterate that the rate comparison I was focusing on was specifically for the case of *not* having a lance. 30 kills/hr isn’t unreasonable in black dhide using an hasta or RCB at mid game stats, so there isn’t exactly a huge barrier there.

> There are high intensity/cost methods that are fast,

So even though I brought it up, lava runners really shouldn't be included as we shouldn't be counting leeching services as viable training methods.

That leaves actual fire-combo runecrafting, and while lavas itself are expensive, steam runes are profitable while remaining very high XP (less than 5% hit to XP rates). 

So crafting combo runes at the fire altar is the fastest method whether you want to break even or spend at any cost. And then since Daeyalt essence was released, that's the fastest XP for low intensity as long as you plan on doing combo runes at any point.

RC is not in a good place. What GotR brought is new BiS gear as a requirement for training RC and a bit of an improvement to existing methods. But RC needs some actual variety, needs a way to earn XP faster than a method unlocked at 23.",2023-02-09 18:36:39,3

Staring at a wall for 10 hours is just as worthless as staring at it for 10 seconds. The problem with RuneScape is that all of its “difficulty” comes from tedium. Even things like fight caves are not hard it’s the hour of your time and the resources you waste getting to Jad and then like a minute of prayer switching. Because of this, the more tedious something is the more rabid people are to defend it. Getting maxed is not hard or an achievement it literally just means you have a lot of free time.

In this regard I do agree. Hard to learn, attention demanding content that has dynamic elements (final part of floor 5) deserves to shine I think. Or at least have a secondary incentive like the RoE hallowed sepulchre drops.

I do think there is a degree of performance involved with lava running though.

In those sizes everyone really needs to know what they're doing for things to go smoothly. Plus, you take damage and need to use prayer during VM, and can die. 

Even if you afk the boulder once everything's set up, you run the risk of taking damage from spewing lava and when things fall from the ceiling. I think the things that fall on you are completely random, but you can avoid the lava by stepping away. It's also easier than someone might think to fall into lava if you aren't paying attention to the platforms you're making. 

I think that justifies 3-4+ teams to get XP equivalent to power mining, and 1-3 to get XP equivalent to tick manipulation.

I think one of the problems is that there isn't really a middle ground with agility. It's either super braindead rooftops or super intense sepulchre. 

Also agility suffers from the same problem that mining has: there is no way to truly afk train it. I bet if there was a real afk method that gave lets say 40-50k xp/hr at 90 agility (real afk meaning 1-2 clicks at least every 60 seconds), then people wouldn't hate it nearly as much. That would bring it to a similar place with other skills that aren't complained about as much with ultra afk methods (fishing, wc, most processing skills, etc). At least then you could get some xp while playing another acc, another game, WFH, school work, etc. Hell even if it was 20-30k xp/hr and truly afk, I'd love it for mobile while at work.

No that's a bug. I'm aware that the shitty trackers all have this bug, because EHP isn't something 3rd parties can actually track accurately, but it's clearly a bug.

You don't use training methods that aren't available to calculate EHP on an account. That's pretty much the entire point of it, so you can compare snowflake accounts.

Abstraction isn't your forté, huh? If I had written yews or magics or mahoganies my argument would have been the same. Relative to current skilling mechanics, punishing players by not grouping (or withholding bonus xp, same thing) doesn't really fit in with the vibe.

Is it ""fun"" to feel like you are missing out on xp/resources because you aren't currently grouping, but otherwise would be training the skill at the same level of intensity? No. It's just an extra hassle.

A hassle, I argue, that isn't consistent with the level of intensity.

As an exclusively iron player, any sort of boosting that ironmen can do (stams from ToB being the big one) is super lame and against the spirit of the game mode.

I'm surprised this question was even polled, it seemed like a given that irons only benefit from their own campfires. They can't use the houses of other players, and they don't benefit from group lunar spells or tele-others. It wouldn't make any sense to allow them to benefit from campfires of other players either.  


EDIT:  
This has received a lot of responses, and I think people are misunderstanding why  I think this is bad, or they are comparing it to group content.  


The issue with irons benefitting from campfires of other players is because an ironman can contribute *literally nothing*, sit at a campfire, and gain some sort of stat boost (which we don't have details on). The difference between this and any group content (besides BA), is all other group content is gated behind certain skill requirements **and** rewards you based off your individual contribution. You can do GotR with other players, but you actually have to play the minigame to get rewarded. If you don't contribute enough you get no reward. Plus the higher runecrafting level you are the better your rewards. You can do a CoX raid as a level 70 with your maxed friends, but your reward is going to be garbage and your chance of a purple is slim to none. With campfires, you could be a fresh account and gain an otherwise unobtainable stat boost *completely* because of other players.  


I would be fine with irons sitting at a campfire but not getting the boost unless you add your own leaves. I would be fine with irons being required to add 1 or more leaves to an already burning fire and get the effect. I am not fine with you sitting at a fire and getting the benefit without having to do *literally anything* to contribute.",2023-03-08 20:31:28,221

I'm just saying instead of minigame ""bosses"" they should make an actual boss encounter in which you use non-combat skills and skilling equipment to fight. Ideally the boss wouldn't be offering massive amounts of XP in any skill, just like how existing combat bosses usually aren't the best XP/h (except Zebak for some reason)",2023-03-09 00:34:20,1

Because it reduces weight, forestry involves running around, and logs are heavy.

Why would someone suddenly stop wearing it? Because it doesn't work with the pouch. What you wear at that point is fashion. Sure, some people will certainly just keep it on, that's fine.

2. 10 mains will share 1 campfire while 10 irons will need 10 separate campfires. This is a scaling issue and I would argue a performance issue if there are too many fires/effects/animations being rendered.
3. Given this logic/reasoning, irons should not get the invisible boost from other players chopping the same tree. This problem worsens when irons are forced off a tree because there are no available tiles to place a personal campfire within the boost range.
4. My idea would only benefit irons that have the reqs/mats to use the fire but not create an additional fire to reduce the total amounts of fires in a given area. An iron would still have to use mats and have the requirements for it, but use the same tile another campfire is on

We don't really have any solid numbers (unless I missed something) on the exact boosts campfires will provide, but they mention boosts to gathering and production skills. Let's say a campfire with redwood leaves give a +6 boost to crafting. If that were the case, you could get the best crafting boost in the game as an ironman with absolutely no requirements.  


Who knows what these boosts actually look like, and maybe if they gave more details it would be easier to decide whether or not this is appropriate for ironmen. But I don't think getting free stat boosts because other players have high woodcutting/firemaking levels makes sense for ironmen.  


A lot of people have been mentioning minigames as a response to this, but there are a couple big differences. Minigames are, in general, designed as group content. It isn't possible to solo them. Also, minigame rewards are (again, in general), based off your own level and contribution. So you can't go into a level 100 pest control boat as a level 3, do nothing, and get your points/gp. You have to be a level 100, and you need to use your skills to actually contribute to the group to gain the benefit. The same is true in tempoross or gotr. You don't need to do these things solo, but you are still rewarded proportionally to your contribution, which depends on how well you played and how high your skills are. This is completely different than getting a free stat boost because someone else has a high woodcutting level.",2023-03-08 21:42:27,5

Campfires give boosts to gathering and production skills. Since they give boosts to production skills, it wouldn't make any sense for them to be invisible. So it's pretty safe to assume campfires gives actual stat boosts, which you can use to boost and create items that you don't have the level to make (a fury or a stam for example). You also don't need to contribute anything to get the campfire effect.

To get pest control points you need to have a certain combat level to join the particular tier boat for pest control. You also need to actually contribute by killing monsters, portals, etc. BA is a bit different because there is no contribution requirement, but personally I think that's an issue. I don't think you should be able to AFK in BA and get points. If they added a contribution requirement I think it would solve that issue.  


Raids are also a bit different because they are specifically designed as group content. ToA is an exception, but the first two raids were literally designed to not be soloable. In addition, your loot roll is based off your contribution. So, sure, you can leech CoX as a level 3 with no skills, but you're unlikely to get anything of value since you didn't contribute anything.

The argument kinda falls apart quickly when you realize that there's nothing ""old school"" about the issue in the first place.  Old school was us wearing full rune and dragon armor all around the game because we knew we would have to walk no matter what.  No stamina potions, fewer teleports, very basic skilling activities, and no skilling outfits meant that we might as well wear what we wanted to look cool.  That's old school.

Still, the big difference is that in something like GOTR or WT the xp and item rewards you gain are directly proportional to your performance in the minigame. The higher your skill levels and the better you are at the minigame increase both your rewards. Campfires would give you the full effect completely based on the skill levels of another player. You would have no requirements and would need to contribute nothing to get the benefit.

Not that this is really important, but most irons fix the braziers at wt because it’s amazing early game construction xp.

Unless you consider "" you sound salty"" to be an insult, in which case you should probably remove yourself from the internet because your too fragile to be here. (That was an insult btw)  


Sigh.. You really want me to go through all your points. Ok lets do it.

*Should we ban IM from clans, so they don't have a social net and are a man alone*No obviously not. And the fact that you are comparing removing the ability for ironmen to use chats to gaining a boost for many different skills from other players without giving anything themselves shows just how bad faith  and salty you are about this conversation.

*throwing in some randomizing, so they can't rely on the wiki?*Again this is obviously over the top. You're being completely bad faith by comparing the ability to use the wiki with gaining buffs from other players in game.

*Both the 10 year event and Halloween had a part of the event that required group play. Should IM be banned from that?*No, things that REQUIRE group play make sense for IM to be able to work with other players. Here is the catch tho, when things REQUIRE group play, you get rewards based off your INDIVIDUAL performance. This can cover your raids and minigames examples as well. When you play GOTR, you play with other players. But you get rewards based off INDIVIDUAL play. If you stand in the corner and do nothing you don't get passive RC xp while everyone else does the work. If you're just there for 5k/hr mining xp you don't get passive rc xp while everyone else does the work. You're rewarded for YOUR individual play and you get xp based on YOUR individual level. The same goes for raids. You could potentially get carried through a cox at level 70 by your max main friends. But you're going to have no points, you chance at a purple is literally almost 0. Because although it's a group activity, your reward are based on your INDIVIDUAL play.

That is NOT the case with this poll. Ironmen shouldn't be able to stand near someone elses fire and get a boost for doing NOTHING. It doesn't depend on their play, their gear, their levels, like ALL other group activities do.

There, are you happy? I responded to all your bad faith salty arguments.",2023-03-09 17:11:33,0

But, at the same time, campfires are either going to give boosts that are just as good or better than current skilling boosts, or they will be mostly dead content (which seems unlikely).

> You typed all of that out and didn't think about how you would feel about people getting easy wc levels to do the same thing you described.

The entire reason I’ve been commenting about this poll is because I think ironmen should need to get the woodcutting levels/leaves themselves to get the boosts. But getting 90 woodcutting for the top tier boost isn’t exactly “easy wc levels”.

> Even if it were from 99 wc and fm it wouldn't make any sense even if its solo only

I’m confused and don’t know what you mean by this

> Also our current boosting mostly comes in the form of soup with little requirement as it is

You’re absolutely right. The issue has nothing to do with how easy it is or how little requirements it has. The issue is that all the level, quest, and item requirements are ones that you need to fulfill yourself, and you need to spend the time to gather the materials to create the boost. If you were able to benefit from campfires you could walk up to a campfire with no stats, no items, no contribution, and get your boost completely from the work of other players.",2023-03-09 06:44:40,0

If it’s a larger boost I think they shouldn’t.” A lot of people feel like mains can help irons if it’s just a little bit, but not if it becomes too much. The point of the hypothetical is that drawing that line is super arbitrary and doesn’t make sense. Either they should fully benefit or shouldn’t at all, and it makes way more sense that an Ironman shouldn’t benefit from the work of another player that they had no contribution to.

Also, as a plugin with a sole purpose of providing guides for quests, why the sudden restriction? If the devs/guide writers believe that doing a quest for the first time without a guide is important somehow, then why do they provide this plugin at all? There are new players to osrs who have never done any quests before yet their plugin can be used by those players. Are they ruining the questing experience for new players by providing guides?

It’d be pretty quick to just add the list of items you need for the quest, which’d let the item filtering in the bank and Grand Exchange work too.

On implementing the rest of the quest though, even just making the Helper is a long, long amount of time. I think I spent 6 hours yesterday on it and I’m still in the very early sections of the quest. I’d be surprised if I have the actual helper functional within 2 weeks, and then I’ll need to get another account through it for testing and such (already missed some important variable changes unfortunately).

I’ll have a chat in the Discord and see what people think of having the item list available.",2023-07-27 07:19:55,12

Yes, old quests are bad and convoluted when you do them blind. I've watched a couple blind-quest focused streamers and there are a lot of pain points.

But I've been doing new quests blind ever since Dragon Slayer 2 came out. They are very intuitive, and I've never felt robbed of my time with unnecessary backtracking. Adding in the fact that we have such a large catalogue of teleports nowadays, having to stop by a bank to grab stuff is hardly much of a waste of time anymore. Nor are there any extremely large, winding dungeon quests that require random items like Underground Pass or Legend's Quest.

Some of the more recent quests like Secrets of the North, Beneath Cursed Sands, and even A Kingdom Divided were extremely satisfying to go through blind, and I'm sad that people somehow hold the opinion that quests are still badly designed and convoluted. I think the ONLY post-2013 quest that might be a pain blind is Monkey Madness 2. But I'll give them a pass because that's literally the first quest they made for OSRS.

That being said I don't mind people who want day 1 quest helper or guides. That's up to them if they use it. But I just can't agree with the claim that Jagex still badly writes quests to be unfriendly to blind playthroughs.",2023-07-26 18:46:07,9

The guy then easily kills the boss without really paying attention to the special attacks of the boss and makes it look like a cake walk.

I try the same thing and get my ass completly clapped. Turns out the guy in the video had all 3 combat stats maxed and a gear set of 100 million+. Something which most people who do that quest wont have acces to.

If I don't really need it then I see no harm in just having it on anyways.

It's more helpful on puzzle type stuff I really just don't have much interest in solving. Like SOTE was a great quest overall imo but still has its big stupid library I'm happy to have a guide to help with.

My perception is probably also skewed because I only started playing in the last year or so so I've done all the quests from 0 back to back.

Saw a zulrah guide with a guy going, ""You don't need any skill to kill this thing. Just step in there and click randomly. Click here maybe? Oh, no, that's not it. Here maybe. Yep! Just hit the fucker. That's all you need to do. Hit it until it dies. Just kill it before it kills you. Simple as that. I don't know why tf everyone is making such a deal about this. If you can't do this, you should just quit the game.""

Meanwhile, the clicks he's doing are anything but random lmao. He's pretending to be clicking like a headless chicken (because; 'any noob can do it without any skill' and he pretends to be one, clicking erratically, to show it's really that easy) but is actually clicking exactly where he needs to.

I think it's just easier to draw the line from my perspective: I've been playing since 2014 and I've had a quest cape for as long as I can remember because it's a good first-goal for an account. Which means, every new quest that I do is obviously a post-2013 quest, since I've already done all the old quests. If you were to start a brand new account now, it's harder to differentiate between what was added post-OSRS and pre-OSRS, so people aren't really going to notice what is technically ""better"" written and more blind-able.

Also, it doesn't have to be in black and white. You can look up the items you need before-hand then do the quest blind. Or you can do the quest blind until you hit a boss then look up the boss if you don't want to waste deaths/money (make quest boss deaths free Jagex). Obviously, everybody should play how they want. I just wanted to offer the opinion that any newly released quest nowadays is far and away more intuitive compared to old dogshit like Legend's Quest.",2023-07-26 19:08:57,1

I didn't actually know what that even was but I just googled it. That would fall under the category of an overpowered boss helper and Jagex has yet to approve anything of the sort. In fact they've removed certain plugins that did similar things.

>The plugin may not automate it to the point of clicking for you, but some plugins certainly narrow the gap by telling you where exactly to click, etc.

As far as I am aware we only have Tile Markers, Screen Markers, Object Markers, and NPC indicators. None of these seem objectionable to me. The only plugins I see for bosses are more informational like telling you which Fight Caves wave will have what, which isn't that different from looking at the wiki.

>Radius markers comes very, very close to this.

It really doesn't. Knowing the range of an attack isn't even close to a plugin highlighting a specific prayer in your menu or popping up with an icon telling you which to use.

>You may see it this way, and others too, but I disagree personally.

You are free to feel that way but I think you are in a small minority. Runelite plugins are basically a shortcut for Jagex to add official features. If they had the resources I think most of what they have approved would be in the base game. Entity Death Hiding for example is really a behavior that the game should have had all along, and only saves the player a right click.",2023-07-27 04:22:38,2

Dragon Slayer 2 -> Myths Quest (Like Legends quest) or Myths of Dragons. Mysteries of the Dragonkin. Etc Honestly Dragon Slayer 2 is such an iconic name that I kinda like it though

Monkey Madness 2 -> Glough's Madness (Parodying Monkey Madness)

As a side example, one of the things I absolutely hated about Majora's Mask 100% mask reward was that there was nothing challenging to fight with the Fierce Diety's mask, and I never understood why people like its equivalent in other games where you just get the supergun and just trivialize everything.  I want the powerful thing to beat the powerful thing, but I want a challenge, I don't want the challenge removed because I found the funny item.

But in a game like Runescape that has constantly done horizontal progression instead of vertical, ancient curses like soul split simply do not belong.  In OSRS you can still die at Zulrah with TBow, you can still die at Verzik with Scythe, but Soulsplit legit in RS3 made it so you could AFK solo Graador if you wanted to, and that was before EoC.  Fuck soulsplit, it does not belong.

My reward for beating ultimate in FFXIV was not a weapon that just completely trivialized the raiding tier, that would have been awful.  It was just a weapon that had one more materia slot than the previous bis weapon.

He had some of the strongest followers and the strongest empire known to Gielinor. The Mahjaarat, Char, Nex, Zamorak. All his followers at one stage or another. He's my favourite God and the one I followed for a long time up until recently.

Then RS3's newest lore kneecaps him and makes him a cry baby. He wants to become an Elder God and everything else be damned. Turns out he built his empire as a way to sell the souls of his followers to something in the shadow realm and that thing in the shadow realm promised to help him become an Elder God. Keep in mind the Elder Gods told him that it was literally impossible to become an Elder God. It's not like they'd lie either, Zaros would be a prime candidate as Mah's heir. The Elder God's are thinning in number and their whole story is about their offspring and their next generation so if they could make Zaros one they would imo.

This isn't a cool overlord, this is a kid who doesn't get his way and sold his entire nation of supporters to an untrust worthy shadow god as a way to possibly get what he wants. In the end he'll probably come back from the shadow realm a corrupted monstrosity betrayed by that shadow god and his humiliation will be complete

Zaros died with the Sliskes Endgame quest, where he wanted to become an Elder God. Ever since then he's been insufferable. Before that it seemed like everything he did had a purpose. It felt like he wanted to defeat the Elder Gods or control the world or at the very least he had some motivation. It felt like he cared about his supporters, had a sense of loyalty to them and cared for them. He had some sort of agency or goals.

Rs3 made the mistake of trying to introduce an alternative way of using them and instead just made it worse by reflecting damage and allowing you to massively heal, meaning that you became immune to damage AND got a boost on damage AND got extra damage on top of that.


As for skilling, not much they can do given that players have already found loopholes and ways to speed it up as is, people 3-tick all day (somehow), jagex can't compete with that at all.  They can add prayers that give a chance to not consume resources, or increase xp, or double resources but... That still won't compete with the best methods players already have.  Plus normal prayers already have some utility prayers like preserve, so even boosts are more or less out of the question.

They never intended to make the raid less user friendly but they still need it to meet up to the difficulty they desired.

I think honestly it was the amount of changes all at once that had caused such a shift in players finding this to be too much. It felt like with the orbs you had to be perfect to not get hit on even lower raid level, combine that with overall reducing supplies that help get people through the previous rooms, coupled with the latest ping issues we've had on servers all of these added up to rather frustrating experiences.

Good to hear Jagex is still trying to provide us content that is achievable yet still desirable.

Longer adrenaline duration is also great. Also, I'm surprised raid lvl 300 is actually *that* much better than 150s, was expecting like 1.5-2x more purples but either way it's good to see the extra raid lvls are properly rewarded. Wonder how this scales further, is raid lvl 450 then 2.5x more purples than 300s (or 6.25x of 150s)?

Are you looking at rebalancing invocation costs next week? Probably a big reason why 150s were easier than you anticipated is how wildly imbalanced raid lvl costs are, and that you set Walk the Path as a default normal mode invocation (hence the ""choose your path order carefully cause it affects the rest of the raid"" statement from trailers and dev blogs). Pathmaster with +3 raid lvls for all paths for 40 raid lvls is laughable. And who wants pick No Help Needed for only 40 raid lvls when that means no salts, ambrosias, adrenaline or any other additional supplies?

Could you guys look into the visual clarity of the lightning shadows in phase 3 of the final boss fight? The shadows stick around after lightning strikes basically creates 2 colours of shadow, one incoming and one lingering. This is by far the most annoying part of the final boss fight.

Fixing this will cause avoiding the lightning to become a lot more consistent for players that are paying attention to the floor, but still take quite a bit of damage due to this lack of visual clarity.

I hope you guys can look into this.

Ba-ba's puzzle room is still just flat out boring, and I think that's highlighted by the fact that the one nerf everyone wants is to make it shorter.

I think the room should better reward correct attacks and pressure players to make them. It would be better if the room had actual mechanics that, if done correctly, made it significantly faster, which is true for the Paths of Het, Crondis, and Scabaras. Some ideas:

1. *Increase* the number of basic baboon enemies and then guarantee the kill + give the player an attack delay reduction if they use the correct attack style on them, making them similar to the red skulls on Wardens
2. Give players ways to clear waves more quickly with clever use of mechanics, such as by making it possible to damage the baboons with the room's mechanics or killing other baboons with the volatile baboons
3. Change the layout to something with obstacles and shift some of the difficulty away from the baboons and on to the traps",2022-09-02 17:04:52,4

Hidden drop rates just makes people less knowledge about what they are buying or selling at the start and leads to people being taken advantage of.

I'll also argue that hidden stats of bosses leads to similar abuse through ignorance. 

Please don't hold back secrets whether it's drop rates, weaknesses, or other hidden mechanics like being skulled at revenant's and you won't receive backlash in the future.

there are quite a few that fit this. then there are a bunch that honestly are way under weighted for how difficult they make the raid. this is the root of the '150 too easy' complaints. yall had walk the path on for the default 150, walk the path makes the default 150 WAY way more challenging than turning on a bunch of useless invocations. just for example.

To sum up, here's what's been hotfixed today:  
  
Keep the Wardens' HP (or Poise) the same as it is now but;  
Increased the hitpoints of the Wardens' Core significantly  
Reduced the hitpoints scaling of the Wardens' Core when additional Invocations are active by 75%  
Increased the Wardens' Core exposure phase duration with each subsequent down. This would mean the first time the Core pops out, it won't hang around for long. The second time around, the Core will stay for a little longer, giving well-coordinated groups an opportunity to synchronise their special attacks for a '2-down'. If you're not able to finish the Warden off by the second down, each time the Core is exposed it'll remain exposed for a substantially longer amount of time, which should provide more than enough time for any player to finish the Warden off.  
Liquid Adrenaline now lasts 150 seconds rather than 60 seconds.  
The Chaos pack for mid-Raid loot will now occasionally offer players doses of Liquid Adrenaline or Ambrosia.  
The quantity of mid-Raid loot offered in the Life and Chaos packs has been increased.  
The movement delay at the start of Wardens' third phase has been reduced.  
Fixed a bug where the Resupply function on the Satchel was occasionally deleting Ambrosia or Liquid Adrenaline doses.  
  
Here's what's been mentioned in this blog that we're changing next week, but keep an eye on next week's blog for more info:  
  
Mid-Raid loot will offer 2-dose potion variants instead of two 1-dose potions.  
We'll fix some of the pathing issues caused by the rocks added to Zebak's lair.  
The in-raid timer will end as the Warden reaches 0hp rather than after the Wardens' death animation.  
We hope to be able to recreate the skip when mining the pillar on the Path of Het.",2022-09-02 17:44:42,1

1. Did nectar's always have a 1t attack delay?

2. Can you explain how the loot design system (qualitatively) weighs increased party size against higher invocation difficulty?

Thank you for adjusting the core exposure time.  
Thank you for adjusting Path of Apmeken to make it quicker.

I like the approach you took with the core exposure time. Hopefully entry mode players won't  be punished too much by Warden phase 2. 

Buffing the Life pack is also a welcome change because it further strengthens the decision-making aspect and better supports entry mode players. I personally take life first and then power or chaos pending supplies.

I feel increasing the Liquid Adrenaline duration from 30 seconds to 150 seconds is OP, maybe 60seconds is a better sweet spot?

I completely agree with your reasoning for the drop rate adjustments (despite the fact I wont see a purple for a long time because I do entry mode)

My biggest complaint is that the P3 enrage phase feels like pure rng whether I can finish in time before there's one row left and no safespots left. I just want the hp or defence reduced marginally so it's consistent with skill rather than just a dice roll whether I'll clear the raid after 40 minutes.

For context, I'm using blessed dhide and a blowpipe with amethyst darts at 99 ranged. Surely that's decent enough to warrant a clear at 150 raid level?

Alternatively, can anyone suggest a replacement for my blowpipe? Are there more effective weapons? I do not have a bow of faerdhinen and I won't be getting one as cg is one of my least favourite pieces of content in the game. Iron btw.

Will a msb(i) with rune/amethyst arrows be better? Or an rcb with diamond bolts?

I got all the amethyst dart requirements shortly before the raid and thought it'd be good enough... Well, they were good enough before the HP was increased. Now it's rng whether I'll dps it down in time whereas before it was extremely consistent and felt fun and rewarding to engage with.

Edit: Just did a run with an rcb at 150 raid level. My client froze at warden p2 (happened at Zebak yesterday as well) but it started during a core phase, luckily. I had to chug brews to recover from the freeze as I took a ton of damage before it unfroze. Meant I had to do an extra core phase but at least I made it to P3 with one brew and one ambrosia. Finished the kill with 10hp remaining and on 1 strip of tiles. RCB might have been better, probably was, but just felt like rng again.

I might try the other weapon suggestions for warden P3, but for now while I'm getting client freeze I'll call it a day.

Really, really disappointed. I was having so much fun with this raid just for P3 enraged to be a dice roll now.",2022-09-02 16:57:31,-1

Been trying to do 2 man raids with my brother on our GIMs and it feels like there's just not enough supplies to get kc at 150 rl. He has bofa, I'm using BP with amethyst darts, both have toxic tridents, got a lucky fang last week and have an abyssal dagger, Fury, occults, tormented bracers. Just had our cleanest run since the changes with mistakes but not repeatedly planking mechanics or anything. Ran out of food in P3 as he went into rage mode after going into the fight with 8-10 brews each and 2 ambrosia/adrenaline each. No rigour/augury. Having 2 dose ambrosias would have made the difference. Not having to chug brews and restores at Akkha when the orbs are dealing 23 damage and he's teleporting around 10+ times cause of all the 0's we're hitting would have made the difference. I barely even notice the reduction in orbs, it's only slightly easier to dodge them, but when you have to chase Akkha around the room 10 times, the increased damage is more punishing than the reduction in orbs is helpful.

I would not mind the Warden's yellow bar HP (not sure how to call the two) being a bit higher so players are required to navigate more obelisk mechanics, if in turn reliable, coordinated 2-downs are possible and 3-downs are the norm.  The 4 and 5 downs I experienced a few times yesterday were tedious and annoying, and should only happen if multiple mistakes have been made.

I'm glad the ambrosia and entry level loot potential changes are not being reversed.  Entry level raids are still very accessible for mid-game players (and **still have** loot potential!), and more invocations are rewarded properly with better odds.  Sounds fair all around.

An unrelated suggestion I'd like to propose is allowing us to add saradomin brews and super restores (and perhaps other food & potions) into our supply pack from the helpful spirit.  Inventory management is a huge struggle in this raid, and I am constantly needing to drop brews on the ground at the start of rooms.  If I could throw them in the pack, I'd have the room I need, and it would better allow me to use nectors and tears instead of supplies brought in.

The buff to the drop rate for higher raid level runs is not at the expense of weaker players. Rewarding more challenging play without punishing weaker ones. 12% nerf is still quite a bit, but it's understandable as the scale between raid levels fits better this way.

A change was made recently were dropping resources on a pile ment the original order you had specifically dropped them in, was now grouped to those same resources. For example;

I collect 7 of each resource in my first gathering stage, usually I would drop 4 bark, 4 ore, 4 cloth ( as this is the perfect amount for tier 1 all armor. Then drop the remaining resources on the same pile & game tile.

This mean I knew when coming back to pick up, they would specifically be in this order. Making it much easier to prep.

Now for no reason all resources are grouped together disregarding the original order you dropped them. So all 7 ore are up top, then 7 bark , then 7 cloth. 

Meaning you are now wasting precious time having to drop much more of your food to accommodate picking up 21 - 4 (wouldn't need the last 4 as you would get 3 x 4 of what you need). 

Can a reason be stated as why this has recently been changed with out explanation? I've reported it as a bug and also commented on numerous blog posts.

I thought the Zebak jugs were supposed to be 1 tickable like the skulls and pillar puzzle.

Please make it the same as the rest where your weapon speed does not matter when attacking the jugs. Ty

That's completely unthinkable for ToB (which has an entry mode which can't get you rewards), and CoX is designed to be done with a group even though it's technically soloable.

Normal mode *is* normal mode. Entry mode is there to let you learn the mechanics while being far more accessible than CoX & ToB. Once you know the mechanics and perhaps have upgraded your gear, you can move onto normal where there's some challenge and rewards become more realistic.

It has to be incredibly challenging to deal with all the Karens and negativity that comes from this engagement, I bet it's worse than working retail. It's never easy to get negative criticism, especially when you put blood, sweat, and tears into your work, even more so when you are extremely passionate or committed to that work.

 items in comparison were objectively bad, but nerfing the best option feels like the wrong decision *especially when an invocation already exists to lower the supplies given by the spirit.* A better option in my opinion would have been to make the other choices more enticing.   


Additionally, if Ambrosia was removed from the ""Power"" choice simply because the name didn't fit the theme, I'd argue that Power as a name itself also doesn't fit as it can be filled by Chaos. Perhaps a better theme choice for that option would be ""Balance"" (which could also fit thematically.

# Mid-raid Loot

Another major concern from players were our changes to mid-raid loot. For a refresher, here's what we changed yesterday:

Ambrosia and Liquid Adrenaline are now 1-dose potions. Liquid Adrenaline now rarely shows up in the Chaos pack. Ambrosia now only shows up in the Life pack. Adjusted the quantity of items provided in the Chaos pack. Increased the amount of Run Energy that Smelling Salts restore. The mid-raid loot interface no longer stops your movement, so you'll be able to withdraw your supplies on the fly!

Following the update, we felt like the changes to Ambrosia and Liquid Adrenaline were too harsh, ***so we hotfixed the game to always provide a minimum two doses of Ambrosia and Liquid Adrenaline.***

***Unfortunately, we're unable to make these singular 2-dose potions via hotfix but we this will be changed in next week's game update***. Those of you struggling with inventory management will no longer have to deal with the frustration of juggling 1-dose potions!",2022-09-02 19:16:26,1

Buffing the Life pack is also a welcome change because it further strengthens the decision-making aspect and better supports entry mode players. I personally take life first and then power or chaos pending supplies.

Honestly the old school team always feels like an integral and connected part of the community, and not some faceless entity hidden away from their community like other games have. I've always appreciated this.

Personally unique loot should just be a linear scale with raid level. If you arent getting the gp/hr you expect from the effort/risk you are putting into expert mode then that is just a skill issue.

do you think they shouldve nerfed regular cox when hard mode was added? of course you dont because that wouldve been nonsense. this is exactly the same and its nonsense now. im not saying better more heavily geared players shouldnt make better gp per hour i know they should and this has always been the case. this scaling droprate though is really going to create a huge difference though. people in full max are going to be making double maybe triple what other players are going to make. this isnt the case anywhere else in the game",2022-09-02 18:17:34,-1

Tombs of Amascut,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/rmvdvr/tombs_of_amascut_and_more_quests/,rmvdvr,hppqff3,None,"Man I’ve been wanting something like invocations in RS pvm for so long! 


Have you guys, the developers, ever considered something like mythic+ (WoW) to give players more control of the challenge, and thus the reward potential? 

I’ve always thought it’d be really cool if you and your boys wanted to do a challenge raid and could select a +5 for example, which would in turn modify enemy stats by a predetermined amount that scales with the +#. 

In other mmos it would increase the power of the drops themselves, but given that OSRS (thankfully) doesn’t have scaling items it would be cool to see a ever so slight increase to drop potential. Hell, it could even modify the chance to roll specific tables within the loot pool if increasing drop chance isn’t something people would want. So for example doing a +10 tob would almost eliminate the chance for an avernic, effectively increasing the drop chance of the other items without actually increasing the chance for A drop. 

Im aware this is similar enough to the current systems that using developer time on it if people wanted it probably wouldn’t be worth, but I’d like to hear what the developers as well as other osrs players think of such a system. Maybe it has no place in OSRS, I just think it’d be neat. 


With the new raid and its invocations it could really carve a path for the devs to make a version of this idea but in a way that suits OSRS.",2021-12-23 18:56:03,2

Here's an expansion on my point with examples to hopefully make it a little clearer: https://old.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/rmvdvr/tombs_of_amascut_and_more_quests/hpow6sg/

I am very glad that more quests are being proposed. I'll be voting yes to all of these questions but not without first saying:

Please, please, please make sure this looks Old School. It's the weakness of a lot of modern updates. I won't be happy if we get another Nex/Torva/TOB/SOTE/Elf Rework situation. It's what I expect to happen, but I've still got to do my token ask.

Also, after Land of the Goblins (which I'm very much looking forward to and doesn't entirely fit in with my coming point), can we take a long, long, long break from backported RS3 content and get back on track with content that fits *our* game? RS3 content already exists and is playable in RS3. I'd rather OSRS went its own way.

(EDIT: This doesn't meant I don't want quest lines finished off because I do. I just want them to fit OSRS in style and atmosphere. This doesn't mean ""RS3 bad"", I like RS3 for what it is but would rather OSRS went its own way and stuck with the tone the game currently has rather than eventually evolve into the tone that RS3 has which doesn't feel like ""RuneScape"" to me.)

As much as I dislike Soul Wars, Nex, and Torva, they aren't a dealbreaker for me just yet. I'm not happy about them, but it's not the end of the world right now, but I'm already pretty disenchanted with the game because of them and any more RS3 content will probs ruin it for me completely.

I'd probably actually be okay with them, or even like them, if the art wasn't so dreadful.

EDIT: It's sad that wanting original OSRS content which the team are so incredibly skilled at providing is a downvotable comment these days. Used to it now though.",2021-12-23 13:28:49,-11

I think OSRS has done a truly incredible job with quests. I am beyond excited for this new desert quest. I will vote yet to every short “tales” quest that Jagex will ever throw at us. 

I just love questing. I have the cape on both OSRS and RS3.

But, truly, I am not so sure about Land of the Goblins here.

I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I think I might vote “No.” It’s not because I’m disinterested in seeing Zanik’s story continue on OSRS- it’s because I already know how that story ends. The quest exists on RS3- with a concluding sequel, in fact, that I don’t believe OSRS would likely see implemented for several years (if ever). 

OSRS quest writers have done an incredible job, both with original quests (A Kingdom Divided) and reimagined RS3 quests (Song of the Elves). If Land of the Goblins is simply a recreation of RS3’s version of the quest- I don’t feel it is in OSRS Jagex’s best interest to dedicate resources to its development. Simply put, I’m not sure I want our limited quests per year to go toward a quest that already exists. I would much rather see either a new quest or a greatly reimagined version of Land of the Goblins- perhaps one that also implements parts of The Chosen Commander, so that it would effectively be the conclusion to Zanik’s story.",2021-12-23 17:43:21,0

there will be a runelite plugin that does the puzzle for you.

To be clear even in RS3 we’ve fought a handful of Dragonkin. One we defeated only because we had magical protection, one we defeated only because we were more skilled and broke his will to continue with the continuous beating he got, he himself was physically fine. (There are the Nodon but those Dragonkin are normal ones, not the ones empowered by thousands of years by the SoJ)

The Mahjarrat we beat a grand total of 3 of those 2 we had the aid of gifted others, and we didn’t win we just didn’t lose. The one Mahjarrat we did beat took extensive preparation to win, the power of the world guardian that let us tap into the heart of the world for power, and we still barely eeked out a win by using the staff of Armadyl.

But more important, **you should add PvM mechanics where weapons with slow attack speed are favoured,** and where the goal should be to kill the NPC in as few hits as possible. For instance the boss could recoil some damage, or even spawn a minion, for every hit you do.

Also would it be such a bad thing if a mega rare from cox was worth more than 10m?

Making them effective in other pieces of content is somewhat reasonable. but the problem is we currently have 3 main crush items, inquistors mace, abbysal bludgeon and elder maul. Bludgeon is a simmilar weapon being 2 handed, but its tier 70 and out dpses elder maul in every scenario except cm tekton. The mace has the same combat lvl requirements (75 possibly changing to 80) it has the better dps than the elder maul and gives the benefit of being able to wear a shield.

This leaves the elder maul essentially unused besides pvp.

By giving a buff that i suggested it would allow it to have better dps than its tier 70 counterpart in certain scenarios. Im open to any other buff, but i fear without 1 their simply arnt going to be scenarios where the elder maul is ever used because mace and bludgeon are simply better.",2021-12-23 14:05:22,76

To give you an idea of what, to me, is the ""right direction""; Tempoross and AKD were absolutely brilliant updates. A fantastic atmosphere and beautiful art that fit OSRS to a T.

I'm also fond of Slepe, the Vampyres quests, and Darkmeyer. Although I don't like The Nightmare, Ver Sinhaza, or TOB - specifically the art, the concept and gameplay are great.

I adore the story elements and quest parts of A Night At The Theatre, but I stand by the opinion that the raid shouldn't be a quest.

I don't mean to come across as sounding entitled, it's just my opinion and I'm not really sure how else I'd express it.

All of the (playable) content I mentioned is actually good in terms of gameplay and concept. I'm up for a new boss behind the frozen door. I love the concept of the Theatre of Blood. SOTE was a great quest.

The problem is graphically, they look awful.

Take [the final room of TOB](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Verzik%27s_treasure_vault.png?428ea) for example. It looks 3D printed, flat, and plastic. It doesn't look like a natural environment. A lot of TOB and Ver Sinhaza feels like this. It doesn't look right.

I absolutely abhor the [elves rework](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Anaire.png/120px-Anaire.png?343fa), and even worse, they changed humans while doing so as well. They look so out of place. Look at [Elena](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Elena.png/120px-Elena.png?5b181). She's one step away from being [Auguste](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Auguste_chathead.png?c63d3).

I don't even know where to begin with [The Grand Library](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Warped_Grand_Library.png).

The Soul Wars NPCs make me want to turn my computer screen off:

- [Destruction](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Avatar_of_Destruction.png/200px-Avatar_of_Destruction.png?0006c)
- [Creation](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Avatar_of_Creation.png/800px-Avatar_of_Creation.png?0006c)
- [Nomad](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Nomad.png/800px-Nomad.png?8e2df)

Do you get where I'm coming from? These NPCs and locations just do not look like they fit in with OSRS. Backported RS3 content looks exactly like that. It looks like RS3 characters in OSRS. I don't see why they can't be reworked into something that fits OSRS.

I miss the days when [this guy](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Hatius_Cosaintus.png/120px-Hatius_Cosaintus.png?2105f) was the worst thing in the game, but at least he almost fits the world... Almost... He's still pretty bloody bad.",2021-12-23 15:23:42,5

But assuming the same QP from the usual barrows gloves path, it would be nice if things like dessert treasure which you have to do or something like swan song which is just a dope quest make up a larger portion of the QPs so if you do these you can skip things like Romeo.

Though I think they did say that it will be about as easy or easier than ToB Entry Mode without any Invocations, even if that won't have great rewards. And the Keris does seem like a pretty nice weapon for KQ even without the jewels.

So compared to Contact, which was 1 QP, 7K Thieve Exp, 14k Combat Exp (no Pray), the Keris, and the Bank, I'd say that 1 QP, 14K Agil, a better Keris, and a Raid is a reasonable step up. But if they did want to add say 8K Craft Exp and a 10K Combat Exp Lamp, I wouldn't complain.

It's a completely different atmosphere and doesn't feel like RuneScape to me.

I agree with this but it didn't become a different atmosphere until a few years after August 2007. Stuff like LotG, Path of Glouphrie etc were written before the backup that created OSRS was created, so they're still very much OG Old School quests, just ones that hadn't finished development by the time August 2007 rolled around.

If they were planning to add Ritual of the Mahjarrat, or even While Guthix Sleeps maybe, I would agree with you, but there's not that much that separates LotG from say, King's Ransom",2021-12-24 16:13:26,3

For me personally, RS2 ended shortly after Summoning. That's when I felt like the game was changing and going in a direction I didn't like and I stopped playing.

Tonally, content after and including Summoning had a different feel to it than the content prior and it took me away from the game a bit. I grew out of the game after those updates and mistakenly refer to it as ""RuneScape 3"".

I don't mean to imply anything overtly negative about pre-RS3 content by referring to it as ""RS3"", it's just that's where the content is now. However, 2009 to RS3 was definitely a different era of the game.

I like RS3 and have actually played a couple dozen hours of it in the last few days, it's just not what I want ""RuneScape"" to be. But for what it is, I like it.",2021-12-23 14:26:40,2

OSRS has been pretty generous with exp rewards. For example, miniquests like In Search of Knowledge and Architectural Alliance give 10K Exp lamps and Fossil Island can give a ton of prayer exp from Fossil, either through lamps or enriched bones.

I won't argue that this deserves to be 38K Prayer exp and I'd be fine if they did tone it down, but for where it is placed in the game it doesn't seem that wild to me. The [original miniquest](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hopespear%27s_Will) required 40 Prayer directly and awarded 13K prayer. The OSRS version may only have the hard req of 25 Prayer, but you do need to have started Fairy Tale 2, started DT, and completed all the goblin quests with reqs like 48 Herblore. Also worth noting that in RS2, Land of the Goblins had a prayer req and gave 2K prayer exp too.

I don't think it would be bad if it kept the 13K prayer exp, but given that they now advise 90 combat they may have made the fights tougher. For context, you need to defeat spirits increasing in difficulty with no gear. All but the first use multiple combat styles and the higher level ones drain stats. So while it might sound easy, it could be reasonable challenging on top of the reqs and perhaps the devs felt 13K exp was too little for the challenge. Like if you could get 4K Prayer exp quicker than you could gear up, kill the final spirit, and bury their bones in the required place then the miniquest wouldn't be worth doing.

But at worst it would be a way for accounts to jump from 25 to 42 prayer provided they did all the required quests and had all the required reqs. And if you can defeat the miniquest's bosses without already having overheads, then you are probably pretty high level or pretty skilled with the game.",2021-12-24 18:44:43,1

I like NM, PNM, and TOB as content. The concepts and gameplay are great. I actually really like NM's animations as well.

I don't like the designs and environments of these pieces of content. The nightmare and its arena are eye sores and TOB mostly looks ugly... Flat and plastic. Obviously this doesn't apply to every aspect of every part of these pieces of content, but that's the gist.

Take [Xarpus and his arena](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Fighting_Xarpus.png?a35b2) for example.

I like Xarpus, it's a good design. It does suffer from the annoying complicated geometry/tessellating shadings that all new content seems to employ, but it's a lot more subtle than [Torva](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/thumb/Torva_armour_equipped_male.png/320px-Torva_armour_equipped_male.png?546a3) which may be the absolute worst offender of this particular ""style"".

Edit: Actually, [Achievement Diary 4 armour](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/images/Elite_diary_set_equipped.png?5693f) is the absolute worst example of overcomplicated tessellating patterns and geometry. I abhor this armour.

If I recall right, it was a rectangular room and the grave markers were in the wall. Also, they could put a timelimit on the fight before they depspawn to discourage flinching.

I've been playing a GIM recently and working on 70 Pray, so I get how significant the exp can be. But at the same time, the reqs and the suggested fight difficulty (90+ combat) seem like it could be pretty fair. Also, it wouldn't be 38K all at once but a bit of prayer after each boss, perhaps with more of a reward for doing them all.

So if overheads are pretty much a req to finish the miniquest which will likely be the case for most lower levels, I don't see 38K being that crazy even for an Ironman. Like by the time you get to the point where you can do it, it will likely be a worthwhile nice little bump in training rather than something crazy OP you do right away. And honestly, I don't mind if there are more quests/miniquests like Waterfall or Witch's House (or Holy Grail) that you want to rush for exp. I see this being another thing that is strong and worth working towards rather than a complete meta shift since it is more mid-game than early game; by that point, you should have a lot of other options.",2021-12-24 20:12:00,3

Bounty hunter is gone because people wouldn’t quit farming emblems after many warnings to stop.

Revs are gone because pvp clans wouldn’t stop locking down worlds and forcing pvmers to pay.

Pvp worlds are so dead because (some) Pvpers rag, skulltrick, AHK, and are generally toxic enough that people like myself won’t pvp anymore.

Wilderness is dead because of similar reasons, many encounters are just baits trying to lower your supplies and TB you for their clan to log in and kill you while spamming toxic slurs.

This post is somewhat misleading with the no votes. The spite voting didn't begin until Sept 18, and it barely made an impact at all.

Seriously there's no reason why anyone would downvote a game mode that has no impact on anyone who doesn't participate in it besides ""Because I'm mad about a recent controversy and don't actually dislike this"" or ""because I personally don't want to do this therefore downvote"".

Those are not reasons to exclude things from the game. The vote system was created so players could block things they think would actively degrade the state of the game in some way, not so you could block updates you're not interested in because it's a skilling update and you only like pvm, or it's a pvm update and you only like pvp, or its an ironmode update and you don't like ironman.

I did however vote yes on the GIM thing since I could see it was in general a widely wanted feature for ironmen. And I felt like there was the possibility of troll downvoting bringing a no vote on purpose.

If there's free money to be made with BH people will exploit it -- not a problem caused by pkers (a lot of the people farming bh rng drops in every iteration since way back 75k tricking in RS2 have been non pkers)

Revs were changed because that style of content just wasn't popular. I personally think revs were fine and working as intended, people just didn't like having to put in the effort to form a team to go lock down a world. There's a culture in RS where ""I should be able to participate in any content at any time, just show up and do it!"" so naturally people didn't like that you had to form a team to control rev caves

Revs were really changed because it was an easy window of already existing content that jagex could modify to give single PKers a good place to go without having to radically overhaul the entire wilderness. Getting good wilderness rules in place is challenging because jagex is working in the confines of an old ass game. These rules used to work way better back when we were dumb kids who didn't understand how easy they were to game.

There are changes I would like to see to make skull tricking less effective and allow you to fight back without being one missclick from disaster (option to only left click attack player if it wouldn't skull you), but even still it's mostly your fault if you get skulltricked outside of crazy scenarios (not to mention this is a jagex problem, not an us problem). 

Baits and tbing are part of the game

AHKing is against the rules. We have no control over other people who AHK. They are already actively reported and blacklisted by pkers

There is no way for us to 'be liked.' This all started years ago from a bunch of redditors having one bad experience with some dumb ass pking them for a spade and going ""sit fgt"" and your attitudes about pkers are already deeply entrenched. I think spite voting is stupid, but people are doing it out of frustration. I think what's happening with osrs has actually developed into a pretty interesting political ecology. We have this minority who feel like they're not being represented by the system, and a majority who see their interests as competing with the minority and want to protect the status quo. Art mirrors life?

Anyway it's all mostly worked itself out. Jagex are already pushing through pvp updates outside of the polling system so I don't think there's much of a problem here to begin with. tldr: probably shouldn't bother reading this because none of this really matters that much lol.

secondly, you can never leave a community to moderate itself - thats why you have a developer who has the grounds and means to do so. the problem here has been the fact jagex have been sitting with their dicks in their hands when it comes to responding to these issues for years. these are the pvp updates no content creators are talking about, but are necessary for any hope of revival in that aspect of the game.

Regardless of the community's view on BH farming, goldfarmers like myself were always going to abuse BH to make money. My Bitcoin is more important than your game experience.

Jagex also drastically improved their bot detection system in late 2019, but that didn't stop Venezuelans from abusing BH. Their Bitcoin is more important than your game experience. Given a choice between prostitution and goldfarming, the vast majority of us would pick goldfarming every time.",2021-09-22 14:28:39,0

Or the lures. The wildy is fun for its broad range of combat, along with the group trips. 

I think clans was a great introduction, the wildy doesn’t need to become safer it needs to be more fun. 

Perhaps mini games between clans. Like man hunt. But not in “separate safe place” like clan wars. 

King of the hill, capture the flag, man hunt, tag, all these games could be implemented in the wildy. I used to do them with friends and each team would have an item we would have to collect to win. 

The wildy doesn’t need things removed like they keep doing bc of toxic pvp players. 

I try and teach ppl about the positive sides of the wildy.i was never a pvper until I hit 85 mining. I had a f2p clan for about 3 years but recently kinda stopped playing.",2021-09-23 03:15:40,1

During this time, other players blatantly broke the rules, but Jagex did a horrible job enforcing those rules and punishing the cheaters. Then in the Final, which is a series of 1v1 fights played on a restricted world, the servers (owned and operated by Jagex) were VERY laggy, which caused the whole event to feel stupid and not a true measurement of skill or dedication. And again this is the only thing the PvP community has gotten ALL YEAR.

The last one was spearheaded by some major streamers, Odablock broadcasted to his ~30k live viewers his vote for no after losing in the tournament, while encouraging all his viewers to go vote no

Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pt4n9x/group_ironman_has_passed_the_poll/,pt4n9x,hdvx1y7,EpicRussia,"Old School Runescape is an online MMO where the players paying subscription fees get to vote on whether content gets added to the game. This means that it is community driven in that the developers cannot add things to the game that the community doesn't want. All content must be approved by at least 75% in a poll in order to be added.

Group Ironman is a game mode where players are restricted to only being able to use items that they or their friends (their group) have acquired on their own. Basically, there is no buying the best gear from other players. They have to get every item for themselves. The game already has a normal Ironman mode where everything has to be done solo, but GIM has been desired for years as a middle ground between being completely solo and having the option to buy the best gear from others. Some people and their friend groups have been waiting legitimately 3 years for this update.

However, it should be noted that the broader community of OSRS is in a way split. There are some players who prefer to play Player-vs-Player, but the vast majority (probably close to 90%) of OSRS players never touch PvP. Instead, these players do Player-vs-Monster activities, which is fighting computer bosses instead of other players.

Jagex (OSRS's developer) usually gives updates in about the same percentages, about 90% of the work they do is for non-PvP players (GIM included), while only about 10% is for PvP. This year especially has been very dry of any PvP updates or content, except for last month, where Jagex hosted a 3 week long PvP tournament. However, Jagex botched it really hard, they didn't enforce their own rules so people were cheating, and in the tournament finals (when all the best players were fighting 1 vs 1) there was so much lag on Jagex's servers that the whole thing was unplayable/unwatchable.

Because of this lack of effort from Jagex, the PvP players, especially the popular streamers, told their audiences to vote No for GIM, to get back at Jagex (their rationale being that Jagex wasted three weeks of their time, so they should waste the time Jagex spent on GIM. Not horrible logic but not great logic either). Remember that they only need 26% No and the vote fails.

Today the vote ended and it passed with 80%. So the hijacking/spite voting didn't work, and GIM will be added to the game",2021-09-22 20:14:31,1

But realistically they'd have to start banning people who buy RWTed gold (something which they don't do atm they only ban sellers) since that's the root cause of all RWT related issues. If there were no buyers there's no sellers and no goldfarmers/much less bots.

Any game update that attracts new players or brings back old players is going to affect shopscape. The only way to avoid it is for the player count to stagnate.

You're specifically talking about the Wildy, and it was terribly implemented from the beginning. The predator-prey dynamic needs to be fun for the prey too. In practice, many people feel it isn't, and its only gotten worse over the years with the steady trickle of new and more powerful items. It's not surprising there's an active amount of anti-PvP spite voters because of it. 

Many also feel PvP has become incredibly inaccessible for new players, and flat out annoying for non-PKers to the point where they try to avoid the area entirely. Jagex tries to mitigate this by adding new PvM content to the Wildy in an attempt to entice more players in, but that doesn't fix the fact that the prey dynamic they've created is more frustrating than anything else. They only ever succeed in boosting player counts in that area temporarily, until an inevitable nerf to profits causes it to die again. There are fundamental design flaws here that consistently fail and cause tension that aren't being addressed.",2021-09-22 15:36:46,1

This is almost exactly the equivalent of 100 people alching rune plates 8 hours a day for a month.

Obviously the number of accounts paying for membership is much, much lower than 1.1m, so I would say that the bond sink is probably almost completely negated just from people alching a single item. 1 trillion gp sounds like a lot, but with millions of players all making gold every day it really isn't that much.

Because of this most pvp updates regarding equipment and new methods usually get shot down instantly because it enables the PVP to kill the Pvmers faster and without a doubt the PVM rule in numbers and I belive this is why GIM was put at risk.

The entire idea of wilderness do not work in a modern setting, and they need to accept that. 

Issues:

1) The death system. Losing your stuff upon death do not work now, it worked in 2007 where value of stuff was a lot lower. In 2021 this just doesn't work, items have completely different values and there is absolutely nothing in the wilderness that will ever justify bringing them.

2) Refusal to address abuse. Jagex do not address the incredibly common abuse that exist in wilderness. Skull tricking and jagex refusing a toggle, clans in single areas, raggers. 

3) Jagex consistently failing at finding a way to introduce a reward. This means that if you want to PvP, the reward will only ever be what you can take from other players. For people that enjoy level 1-2 wilderness that should of course stay, but for everyone else this just leads to wilderness not working.

There are many solutions to how to handle it, but Jagex will not address any of the core issues. Their solutions have typically been one of:

1) Give more incenives for non-PvPers to go into the wildy. This feels bad for the hunted and will only make them bring 3 items anyway so we get famous spade memes. It doesn't work at rejuvenating wildy, and is a large reason for why people now won't vote in anything that helps PKers.

2) Give them minigames with rewards. Always gets abused by bots due to how they want to implement a semi ranked system.

As long as Jagex refuses to do anything about the core issues with how wilderness works in a modern setting as opposed to 2007, wildy will remain broken and cause huge animosity between PvMers and PKers. And it's not on either of the groups hands, it's on Jagex hands.",2021-09-22 13:21:25,0

Yes spite voting obviously happened, by a small handful of players, the majority of the pvp community came together in an attempt to spite everyone else, streamers, people with real influence over the game used their platforms to also push their agenda on this . Show me once… literally once that has happened for pvp updates . I don’t vote no on pvp stuff, I love pvp, but while it remains hunter vs prey it’s inherently flawed and they want buffs that make it easier to kill the prey. What part of that aren’t you getting, it’s not a spite vote if it genuinely makes some one else’s experience worse. 

Then you pop off and say “wElL dOnT eNtEr ThE wIlDy” and then people don’t and it continues to die even further. Then finally to top it all off, pvp updates are getting pushed through as QOL even after not passing polls so really it’s a whole bunch of crying for nothing.",2021-09-22 21:00:24,2

What? 

First off, the wild is huge, it's far too big, there's too much dead ground it should be far more compact to allow you to find targets easier.  
Secondly, it's absurdly easy to just tank til you can log, or even tank to the border, assuming you have....
Supplies, if you don't bring supplies to deal with a pker then the expected outcome should be death, why wouldn't it be?  

>it worked in 2007 where value of stuff was a lot lower  

Huh? Didn't a whole load of shit cost way more back then.  

> items have completely different values and there is absolutely nothing in the wilderness that will ever justify bringing them  

Then what's the problem, don't bring them, and don't go into the wilderness. If Jagex releases something that tempts you into the wilderness, and you lose said item, surely there ***was*** something in the wild worth bringing them, purely logically speaking?  

>Refusal to address abuse. Jagex do not address the incredibly common abuse that exist in wilderness. Skull tricking and jagex refusing a toggle, clans in single areas, raggers.   

Agreed.  

>Give more incenives for non-PvPers to go into the wildy. This feels bad for the hunted and will only make them bring 3 items anyway so we get famous spade memes.  

If all they're losing is a spade, why does everyone hate pkers so much, they're probably like 50gp, and they spawn, for free? That logic doesn't add up.  

Also the ""hunted"" is actively choosing to go into the wild, taking the risk, they hate it because the negative thing happens, like when I die to Vork and think fuck this and alt f4.",2021-09-22 15:19:16,2

At an average of 5m (and a current price of 5.2m) that makes it around 500k (520k currently) to make it tradeable again.

And it's funny that you mention that alching items is far less efficient, then say to just alch the members items to drop over. Yeah, lemme just alch this whip for 120k instead of selling it for 1.8m. 

>**Your alt doesn't need to be a member**. You can alch members items and trade over F2P items to sell on the GE, or you can **save up members items on the alt until it becomes worth it to buy a bond too.**

Alt doesn't need mems, but stockpile members items on it? Okay. You also recommend buying bonds after stockpiling to make it more efficient, while completely ignoring the fact that it would still be 5m for a bond on the main plus 500k times however many bonds you bought with your stockpile to trade them over to the iron **instead of just having it be regular price for irons**. 

You say that the change is pointless, but it saves irons tons of money, which you also claim is difficult to get on an iron. You say you don't need members and to just alch members items for an insane decrease in money, then turn around and say that you could buy a bond for your main to sell members items after stockpiling, ignoring the fact that it is still way more expensive to do that than buy a bond directly

A trade interface won’t open for ironmen. You can’t pick up items from monsters if you were assisted in killing that monster. They’re built in.

I only play Ironman anymore because in the normal mode, I would just do whatever made me the most gold in the least amount of time in order to afford to do skills/other content. Ironman’s appeal is that you have to build your account from the ground up and do all the content, early, mid and lategame, and not just what’s most efficient. Gives a massive sense of accomplishment compared to the main style, at least for me.

As for the resources thing, I’ll use an example: if a “main” game character wants to train their smithing, they’ll kill whichever boss has the best gold/hour for them, and use that gold to purchase the supplies they need. They *could* train their mining by mining the raw material, but usually the fastest method for mining experience is just dropping your ore since you can make far more gold doing other activities. So to train mining/smithing, it’s usually power mine (drop ore) and buy raw material for smithing

For an Ironman to do smithing, they must find the resources in their way of choice: Use their harder to earn gold (since they can’t just sell their monster drops for gold) to buy materials from the NPC store, running back and forth to the bank since they only have 28 inventory slots, train your mining skill and mine the raw materials, or see if any monsters have that raw material on their drop table and farm that monster.",2021-09-22 15:49:52,20

Your character isn't locked to a server, and you can switch between any of the hundreds of servers in seconds.

On the appeal of ironman, it varies from person to person. I enjoy it because it makes the game feel more immersive, and the main appeal is removing access to the Grand Exchange (auction house)

If a regular player wants to make a crossbow for whatever reason, they would just buy all of the requisite parts off of the Grand Exchange and slap it together. 

An Ironman would have to go chop down a tree, cut the logs into a stock, mine some ore, smelt that into a bar, smith that bar into limbs, put the stock and limbs together, then go pick flax, spin the flax into a bow string, and finaly string up the crossbow.

Yes, specific items had higher prices, as in, lots of items weren't at alch value. That's not at all what anyone talks about though. People talk about cost of high end gear today vs. high end cost then.

> Then what's the problem, don't bring them, and don't go into the wilderness. If Jagex releases something that tempts you into the wilderness, and you lose said item, surely there was something in the wild worth bringing them, purely logically speaking?

I'll reword mysef: People refuse to bring actual items to fight back because high tier gear is too much of a cost to lose. Therefore they bring the bare minimum to get their task in wild done, regardless of what it is.

> If all they're losing is a spade, why does everyone hate pkers so much, they're probably like 50gp, and they spawn, for free? That logic doesn't add up.

The spade is more of a meme about what people dislike. You can put effort into a clue and then either have to go into wildy where you often get attacked and the only thing in it for the attacker is the spade.

Maybe for you, Ironman exists to play and grind alone and that gives it more meaning. 

For me, and my boyfriend who'll be my partner in Group Ironman, it was never about being alone, it was about taking the long way around, doing everything for ourselves and having a greater appreciation for the sheer amount of content and detail that Jagex put into the game. Not being to trade or use the GE forces us to actually play the game in a way that we wouldn't normally. 

Taking on that challenge with the person I cherish most in this world is what brought me back to OSRS, why I paid for my membership and why he paid for his. 

On a larger scale, this toxicity and gatekeeping how others enjoy the game is the reason this drama happened in the first place. Don't like the concept of GIM? Fine, don't play it. Don't like PvP? Fine, don't go to the wilderness or engage in PvP. Its okay that we all enjoy this game in different ways, we are all on the same side, we are all OSRS players.",2021-09-22 22:17:42,1

No, doing it the way they did it was the best way possible to hurt the company. How many people have been holding off on subscribing for GIM?

I’m just saying as someone who doesn’t go into the wild, additional content there does nothing for me. I’d rather the OSRS team devote their time to other stuff than the wild. It’s not a fun aspect of the game for me and I’m gunna treat it as such. The fact that PKers feel entitled to have content locked inside the wilderness so that they can kill people who don’t want to be there is absurd. 

If a poll was, for example, to add dragon picks to the steel dragon drop table and triple its rate in the wild I would be fine with it. It gives me an outlet to get an item without dealing with the wild and risking my stuff and it gives a risk/reward for people that want to go into the wild. If a poll is to add a new weapon to the drop table of a wild boss, but only that wild boss, I’ll vote no because it does nothing to benefit me and I play on Ironman so there’s no way for me to obtain it without going into the wild.",2021-09-22 13:53:20,-2

There’s just this confusion because PvP polls would affect PvM gameplay and in particular, any content that would add PvM content into the wilderness would be detrimental to PvM players. So obviously they’re going to vote no on content detrimental to them.

GIM really isn’t detrimental to anyone at this point, especially since the work for it has already been done. So the PvP community voting against it is entirely doing it out of spite.

The only thing they have ensured is that spite voting against the PvP community will especially be a thing now.",2021-09-22 12:37:34,0
Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pt4n9x/group_ironman_has_passed_the_poll/,pt4n9x,hduwr1y,danzey12,"> I'll reword mysef: People refuse to bring actual items to fight back because high tier gear is too much of a cost to lose. Therefore they bring the bare minimum to get their task in wild done, regardless of what it is.

So, what's the problem, the player has chosen gear they feel comfortable losing, that's good enough to do their job, they get jumped by a pker, and lose it. Such is life.  

Again, the bottom line here is players dislike when the possible bad thing happens, but that's just your luck of the draw.  

>The spade is more of a meme about what people dislike. You can put effort into a clue and then either have to go into wildy where you often get attacked and the only thing in it for the attacker is the spade. The alternative is abandoning the clue all together. It's not about losing the spade. It's about how current state of wilderness fosters hate between the 2 groups.  

The surely, by your own logic, pkers should be rewarded with some sort of item, or point value, if they pk someone that is currently holding a clue step, because... 

1) You're saying they put effort into a clue and the pker gets just a spade for ruining it, therefore if the pker gets a lot more than a spade out of it, something proportional to the effort of the clue, it'll be a much more meaningful exchange.    
2) If the Pker kills the player after they complete the step, but before they escape, then there's a chance the pker will get the drop from the clue, which is an equal trade, because that's what pvp is.  
3) If the step is not worth going into the wild for, simply don't go, this doesn't make it ok to complain about doing the step, I don't get to complain about steps that take me to areas I haven't unlocked yet, or do things I can't do, so why would it be ok to complain about something you *choose* not to do.  

Seems like this part is solved, Jagex should implement something, where, if you pk someone holding a clue step, you get a reward equal to ((clueStep * modifier)* clueTier), by your own logic.",2021-09-22 16:01:11,-3

Dude, what you said is *precisely* what I said after the announcement of group at Runefest 19. Then I actually had a debate with someone in a YouTube comments section cause I was like “lol if u wanna trade just be a main lol.” 

This dude explained to me about how hype it will be to work together, how your friend getting a drop can completely change the entire game for you, being in a discord call all doing quests together or running through the desert treasure pyramid and laughing at who falls through the floor. 

Highly recommend checking out the GIMP series by EVScape, Ron, Skiddler, and Purpp. That was the last straw for me to say, “Okay, group Ironman is gonna be insanely fun, even if it sounds kind of weird in concept.”

It’s going to be awesome, man, and with an 80 percent yes vote of 140k, I assure you, this won’t be dead content anytime soon. The fact that you can switch your teammates off the team if they’re not  playing anymore guarantees it. Someone will ALWAYS want to join a group Ironman that has any foundation. Not everyone will.

Currently most people drop dupes over and buy a bond on a normie account to then use on their iron. Why this sucks is because one, you have to have two accounts with member ship if you want to drop members items over, and two you have to pay a 10% fee to make the bond transferrable after buying it to use on your iron.

The way they're currently implementing it is that irons can use the GE to buy bonds with the gp on their iron man. So, that metaphorical tbow you just got is worth ~1/3 of a bond if you choose to alch it and buy a bond with your iron gp.

You saying that you would use ironman gp to buy bonds means you won't use the money from dropping dupes to a normies account to then sell and buy bonds, but instead use the money you have on your iron from alching and what not.",2021-09-23 19:56:54,1

You should vote for the health and spirit of the game, like things that are old school appropriate and take a break from the efficiency mindset.

Luckily you don't have to rely on unreliable people. You can either not play, or join up with your reliable friends.

I fully expect the one returning to not stick through a long period of time, and that's okay. I'm not focusing on the leaderboards, so having him join in at the start, and then whenever he wants to is perfectly fine by me.  
  
Having a group of 4-5 people end up at 2 in a few months is fine. Most people I've talked to are fine with that.

""If i had to pick between playing my main and farming gold or playing my ironman and dropping the items to sell, it's still more gp per hour to use an ironman"". 

Perhaps I wasn't overly specific, but I am referring to two identical methods of obtaining gold, but on different accounts. Everything sellable on a main account is also sellable from an ironman, all you have to do is drop it over.

Just because one option is used, it does not invalidate the other option from co-existing. In an identical gold-creation scenario, there is no limiting factor to playing an ironman. The account with better gear simply does content faster, earning more gold in the same amount of time. You can just spend extra gold from alchs on bonds straight from the ironmans cash stack, and you can also buy bonds for 10% more gold by selling dupes from a main.",2021-09-23 20:58:27,1

Where is this coming from?  I feel like you're just trying to push this into my comment.  I literally *just* said ezscape has nothing to do with it.  If shops were reworked to not require hopping but were magically *exactly* as useful as they are now, my complaints would be satisfied.  Ezscape is an entirely different argument, and not one that I'm making.

>hopping worlds for other things can be fun. dks hopping, GWD, even wintertodt hopping.

Unless you're talking about crashing people (which obviously is cancer), I sort of disagree.  We'll use GWD as an example.  Again, the same logic applies: hopping being meta is bad gameplay that can be solved.  Yes hopping can be more fun now, but **that's literally the issue**.  It shouldn't be more fun to hop, the system should work well enough on its own so hopping isn't beneficial.

If there was a button that respawned the boss immediately, you'd never need to hop except for finding an empty world.  Excluding oversaturation economy issues (mostly an issue with GWD), this smooths out gameplay without actually changing anything else, because in many cases worldhopping just accomplishes this same thing only clunkier.  

(GWD is kind of grandfathered though, removing the oversaturation would crash the market very quickly.  But that in itself means GWD is flawed, because it's doomed to crash slowly even if we don't do that, which we've been watching happen for ages now.)

And you might think ""a button that respawns the boss"" is insane, but there are a huge number of bosses that already do this.  eg. Nightmare, Vorkath, Grots.  CoX and ToB are instantly ready to go again too.  And bosses that respawn incredibly quickly such as Corp are *effectively* the same thing.

Just imagine any boss you *don't* have to hop for, such as Nightmare, and now imagine that you had to hop after every kill.  Other than that, imagine that your kills/hr and everything else stays the same.  Is that not worse now?  Everything I'm saying is the same thing, but the other way around.  Apply this logic to shops.  Imagine you get the same items/hr, but you don't have to hop.  Is that not better?

Beyond that, if it's not meta it's not relevant.  Such as if you're hopping to find people to join up with.  That's perfectly fine.",2021-09-22 16:31:03,3

I think the essence of group iron-man is getting missed here.

There shouldnt be restrictions on certain items just because you don't have the requirements. Everyone's plan is to split up and have different members of the group do different things. If all of us need 85 slayer to use a whip it seems redundant.
Also im not a fan of how 1 person from the group can go to cox/tob with normal players outside group. This is going to lead to people farming in their mains and have 1 person on their GIM account in the party in hopes they can feed them items. It should be 'you can only do this content with members of your group' remember you stand alone together.

Please don't rush this otherwise it'll just be iron-man mode but you have help to kill Godwars, corp and a couple other bosses.

Under 'Recruiting into existing groups' it states that:

However, under 'Context restricted items' it states that:

* ""*Please note, the 1kc requirement applies to you* ***if you've left your group and joined a new one***, *or if you join an existing group (i.e you are not prestiged anymore)*"".

My question is how would a GIM player '*leave*' their original group and later '*join a new*' group? This seems to contradict the prior statement that once a GIM player has left the Node they '*can no longer join a group*'.

What about a system wherein each member of the group contributes to the *groups* hiscore total. So it shows each player, their skills and exp, next to the groups entire skill and exp totals. 

Hiscore rankings would be based on whichever groups have the highest overall, rather than any individual players. If you have 3 people in your group for example, your ""cap"" would be all 3 people getting 99 in each skill, and 200m exp beyond that. So 297 total in any skill and 600m exp. Or 396 and 800m exp for a 4 person group, etc... 

How does hardcore work in this scenario? If one person dies, their individual contributions to the teams overall ranking is frozen in place, just like how current hiscores are frozen when a hardcore dies. 

So in a 3 person team, if one person dies immediately to a goblin for example, their team would now effectively be capped at 198 in each skill and 400m exp. If they achieved level 50 in each skill before they died, then their 50 levels will still contribute to teams total, but levels they gain afterwards would not. 

A system like this rewards teams who stay alive from a hiscores perspective, without punishing the entire group and losing everyone's status over one person dying repeatedly. If one person dies in my group it's not the end of the world, because I can still keep *my* life safe, and continue making hiscores progress for my team while whatever progress they made before death is locked in.",2021-09-01 13:31:11,1

* No High Scores
* Group size limit of the clan system.
* Let group ironmen boss together
* No shared storage system
* If someone wants to leave the group, remove all items from their bank and convert to normal account
* Anyone can join the group from tutorial island if invited. 

How this is different from a normal account:

* Players can be creative, you could host a 1 month group on rushing to a specific boss pet in your clan. Or you could see how quick your group can create 10,000 brews from scratch. 
* Economies are completely separate, large groups could be similar to pre-ge OSRS. See Path of Exile's private leagues for some ideas.

Even the 5 weeks you're proposing is the blink of an eye in the progression of an ironman account, so all it does it make boosting slightly slower. No matter what you do players will find a way to game your system, and they will have a massive advantage in the high scores. At the end of the day the GIM w/o prestige highscores will be meaningless, regardless of what you do.

If someone boosts, they know what they did. No one expects this game mode to have integrity. People already pay to have other players do grinds for them on IM mode. Random events weren't a solution to bots. It was an annoyance, and that's what these restrictions are.

I'm not really worried about that 1kc requirement because it will never pass community scrutiny, but you should remove all the other restrictions. Don't delete players' tradeables and don't limit wealth transfer. There's also no reason ironmen shouldn't be able to downgrade to GIM.

I think the content restrictions need to operate in both directions. At the moment, it prevents a high level group absorbing a new low level member and boosting them up, but what about the converse? What if a high level member joins a group of low levels, gets them all tridents and whips and then is free to leave?

This comes from the perspective of a group of friends that have been waiting a long time for this. We realize that you are trying to prevent boosting, but think this will still make it work without impacting legit groups that just want to play together. I thought some of these had been made clear on the stream, but the conversation still makes it seem confusing, so I'm sorry if I cover something that's been addressed by the team.  


Regarding PvM restrictions. We, and I believe a lot of other groups as well, were planning on specializing in aspects of the game to progress as a group more quickly. The 1kc restriction I think is a good idea, But it should only be applied to non-prestige groups. Groups that started together and stayed together should have the opportunity to have someone farm 3 whips for the other guys that are feeding the group other materials.   


Expand the prestige system. Or at least add conditions to lose prestige. Make prestige groups basically base ironman with a 2-5 man economy. You can set your parameters and restrictions to lose prestige. Once prestige is lost, you fall into that category of possibly being able to boost/be boosted and you have to start jumping through hoops. This would also help to give prestige status...actual prestige outside of a cool icon on the leaderboards.   


In essence, if I rambled... Allow prestige groups to play the game.. lay on the restrictions you feel are necessary for non-prestige groups in order to preserve the game mode.  


Maybe controversial... But consider releasing the game mode when the base game mode works. Osrs is a very long and time consuming experience, which is why most of us play. Allow us to start the journey, even if it is barebones at release. This also allows you the luxury of adding more unique features and allows you testing/dev time without stressing about pushing release date. I can certainly handle trading with my friends personally for a few months before you get shared storage right.  


Ive seen this one before so ill keep it short. But please dont poll the base game mode, but rather poll additions to it afterwards. Ironman was great for the game. Group ironman will be as well.   


We thank the entire team for their work on this alongside everything your doing for the game. We patiently and eagerly await the arrival of this awesome game mode.",2021-09-04 00:33:10,1

Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pfr3no/group_ironman_blog/,pfr3no,hcupunx,Deadlyladen,"Regarding leaving groups and losing untradeables.

An item possession system, similar to other MMOs - in WoW, if you crafted an profession item, it would tag it 'created by_'. If an item is crafted by you, or looted by you - it becomes tagged to you so it's connected to your account and you don't lose it when leaving groups; and now if you're in a new group, that item becomes officially untradeable. Since at it's 'creation' the old group that existed is when it was tagged, and is now different than the current.


Can we input a system where **IF I** was the one that killed an abyssal demon and looted the whip myself, this item now becomes flagged to me - so I worked for it, received it, and now when I leave a group it stays with me. Another example, if I worked hard and farmed a zenyte and the crafting, made a torture - this account now crafted this item, and it's flagged to me - so if I leave the group, it follows. 


1) Are untradeables similar to how PVP works? If you have a charged blowpipe, it's technically untradeable but can be made tradeable later. If you leave the group, do you still lose blowpipe? Similar to dying with one in PVP?


2) What if you're in a situation where you're forced to change groups; original group died off, item griefing, you generally want to play with new people. How are we expected to stay in our original groups and recruit new people that aren't fresh accounts? What if we don't like our leader, and they don't like us - I don't want to lose my tradeables, what if I earned those? Then, we're now forced to lead, recruit newbies, we won't be able to get experienced ppl because they also don't want to lose their tradeables.

Can you guys guys reconsider the HCGIM death mechanics? I don’t see why HCGIM should be different from the main game HCIM. HCGIM is supposed to be less restrictive and focused on group activity but this change makes it even more restrictive than even main HCIM. The best content will still be unsafe activities and I feel like this just punishes players for internet connections at places like CoX. It also makes mini games unsafe such as Pest Control, NM, fight caves. What’s the purpose of this?

As an alternative, make it so HCGIM cannot do group content that is otherwise safe and open to others with other players to limit boosting OR add a  teleport out option into CoX.

I feel this is far too punishing for the average player and will result in being a streamer-only variation of the game which is a bummer because I know people personally who would otherwise play HCGIM but arent into the death mechanics as stated in the blog.",2021-09-01 16:59:57,4

The majority of people who actually play HCIM believe that deaths should only be unsafe when that death results in the loss of items and re-spawning at your spawn point.

But it's abundantly clear that people on the dev team (who, it should be noted, don't actually play HCIM) also now wish they'd made all deaths unsafe for HCIM in the first place.

I would hazard a guess that the reason is that the HCIM game mode is in a unique position where it's more profitable for them *not* to design the game mode according to what the actual people playing the game mode want, because the game mode does more for the popularity/marketing of the game in the streamer content it produces than in attracting players to play the actual game mode itself.

I heavily disagree with this statement. My GIM team is going to consist of my brother  and I. We're expected to both learn and complete ToB as a two man instead of going on learner raids like any normal Ironman?

My guess is most of the players who will come back to gim will be the more casual group who want to do stuff with friends. But being forced to have even more restrictions than if we were solo ironmen doesn't make sense imo.

In that same vein I agree that there shouldn't be kc requirements for items. But if they want to add kc requirements, it should be for new players and not Prestige groups since I believe the intent is to prevent boosting

Edit: it is for Prestige groups only.
This is the wording for the ""new players"" section.

Only applies to new joiners to existing groups, not prestige groups. Its a measure to stop boosting level 3 joiners to having better gear to level faster and get quest progression / untradeables unlocked. Hand back gear, leave group to start their ""real"" group. Same reason untradeables can't be tradeable without then creating a situation where they absolutey must wipe an account on leave, to prevent a boosting meta (and untradeables to me are always *your* accomplishment).

I doubt they'll recode the engine behind Boss KC's either, as that would make for some incredibly fast boosting content for all accounts in the group, just for being there, and would likely create a boosting meta too.",2021-09-01 15:22:15,1

The unfortunate thing about doing it the way they desired on, which to be fair is probably the best way, is that there isn’t much benefit from pooling resources. After doing some planning the quest requirements for useful untradeables or unlocks mean you kinda need everyone to do everything. At least at the early levels. I was just curious if this design choice was considered when determining the rules for the flexibility it would provide well organized groups.

EDIT: Also I think thematically it fits. The Group is kinda like a DnD adventuring party. Everyone in a party doesn’t go the same quest/story independently. Each person specializes for certain tasks and the whole party shares the reward. The idea they are going with makes everyone do everything from the get go, like everyone is gonna want a slayer helm, so you need to get everyone to 55 crafting. Everyone is gonna want slayer rings, so everyone needs 75 crafting. Everyone is gonna wants fairy rings, so everyone needs 36 wc. Everyone is gonna want ancients so 53 thieving and 12 magic logs for each person. Barrows gloves so 70 cooking each etc.

Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pfr3no/group_ironman_blog/,pfr3no,hbb4e22,neorean,"For sure.

Gauntlet is especially silly because not only is it a safe death for other account types, it doesn't even consume supplies, it literally costs other accounts nothing to do Gauntlet whilst for HCIM it's one of the riskiest things in the entire game.

This inconsistency genuinely creates an imbalance issue in the game as devs design new content with the availability of current gear in mind, so if the rewards from Gauntlet are basically free to get after SotE for everyone but completely impractical to get for HCIM, future content is likely to be less balanced for HCIM too, creating a snowball effect.

I asked about this on one of the Q&A streams and /u/jagexayiza literally just laughed at the question and said something like ""if you want deaths to be safe, why play a hardcore"", completely missing why this is an issue with gauntlet specifically and assuming that wanting any death to be safe means wanting all deaths to be safe.

The team has made it abundantly clear that they consider it a mistake to have even included any safe deaths in the game mode in the first place, one of the devs (I forget who) explicitly said that on stream in the past. (Again, nobody on the team actually plays HCIM.)

So I think with HCGIM this decision is most likely motivated by two factors, firstly it lets them remove all the safe deaths which is clearly what they *want* HCIM to be now, but it's too late.
And secondly as I said before I think that the primary focus for HCIM as a game mode is as a ""streamer game mode"" now that it's proven to be so useful as a marketing tool thanks to streamers.

HCGIM plays perfectly into this, it exists to create Twitch and YouTube content for groups of content creators, the shared lives, the ludicrously punishing rules, it all plays perfectly into creating tension and drama.

I'm so disillusioned with the game mode at this point, I started at the release of the game mode and the vision for it then was completely different than it is now; aside from maybe Zulrah the game had a long-standing precedent that any content where you are *expected* to die was made a safe death and the release of CoX and the Inferno seemed to confirm this direction.

Even with Zulrah there is a safety-net extra-life as a diary reward (fwiw, I think this is literally the perfect solution as it satisfies both streamers and regular players; the option to make extremely dangerous content safe but at the cost of insanely high requirements (including doing the content without a safety-net at least once) making it massively inefficient so that you can't compete for hiscores.)

But as we know, the design philosophy of the dev team changed.

If I weren't 2000 hours into my HCIM and very nearly 2k total I'd consider playing a regular iron instead... except the whole reason I play HCIM not only still stands but has actually gotten stronger; outside of HCIM the game has absolutely no meaningful punishment for death.

I've spoken to so many HCIM players and this has been by far the most common thing I've heard: they play HCIM because the regular game with modern death mechanics is so unpunishing that death feels meaningless and in turn all your accomplishments feel meaningless, it ruins the enjoyment of the game to not have any meaningful cost for dying.
But what the dev team and reddit want HCIM to be now (streamer-man mode) is way too punishing for the vast majority of players, as soon as you die on your HC the game once again loses death carrying any punishment from that point forward.

Unless you remake... but the only people who have the time or inclination to start all over again after investing thousands of hours are people who play the game as a full-time job.

I'm pretty certain that if they actually polled HCIM players about their game mode, it would follow that original design philosophy, but satisfying the actual players of HCIM is obviously not the goal otherwise they *would* poll us.",2021-09-02 12:37:21,2

That said I do think a group vote-kick is useful, but inactivity can create problems there. If you're in a 5 man group, do you need 3 votes to kick? What if 3 people were Inactive at the time? Is it now just impossible to kick?

> I could be iron with a good group and leader for 2-3 years. Suddenly the leader goes into depression and just wants to be a dick and ungroup everybody without stepping down. Your solution is ""Well, you should have known he would have been a good guy for 3 years, then he would go into a depression state where he just doesn't care and remove everybody, you should have known!"" Look how silly that sounds?

Thats a shitty situation, but a simple solution as well is during this grace period allow people to ""disagree"" with leaving. So if they aren't inactive they aren't *forced* to leave, so Leaders can't be toxic like that. Then you can have this 'majority rules' veto system to force remove them if they're active but you simply don't want them in your group anymore.

Theres definitely going to be some concerned players around this stuff, but most of it comes down to similar rules in the maingame. If you don't think you can trust someone, don't play with them. If you're fearful of someone removing you from a group, you probably want to be the leader of said group.",2021-09-02 07:06:02,1

* Fremenik Trials fight (according to old wiki is currently a safe death. It's kinda ""meant"" to happen in the quest though)

&#x200B;

>A player who is kicked from a group will also have a short grace period of seven days

Hmmm just seems the leader can have too much control and basically fk up years progress if he wants to kick someone out. Sure you got trustworthy team, but a lot of people are grouping with others they met online here or discord. People on the internet aren't exactly too trustworthy so you're now saying to not do GiM at all ?

Let me throw this out to you. For example say I play 2 years with somebody and as within that time I get a super rare drop like ""Scythe of Vitur"". I lend it to leader who I trust these 2 years, so now I tell my group  I'm going on vacation and won't be playing for 2 weeks. What about if the leader just decides to remove me while he holds my scythe and other rares? I come back to see I don't have scythe and now I have to deiron or lose everything... What about if my other people in my group knew he was doing that and could reject me being kicked out?

To add more onto this I can't even appeal me getting kicked out even if I'm an active player. Heck someone could get kicked out just because they want an irl buddy to join the group of 5. Please don't use the ""Don't chose an untrustworthy leader"" excuse.. Shit happens a voting system can help with that to prevent a leader for kicking you out for whatever reason...  It will happen to some people.

**The voting system could use the same logic as ""Inactive => 30 days"", and would need > 50% to approval from ""Active"" players.**  For 5/5 active it would need 3/5 to kick someone. So if it's 4/5 are active then at least 2 players would need to approve the kick, leader and one other. For 3/5, 2 players would need to approve, for this scenario It's recommended the leader steps down because obv nobody agrees with him. For 2 player group, leader can kick just because it's 50% and he's the only one in control.",2021-09-02 08:08:22,2

Exactly, there is no difference. If really needed, you can wait with implementing this demotion for like 6 months or so.

I do think it still an inconsistent rule. Here is why- if I start with a group, I can use whatever items they get. If I join a week later, I am locked out of using these items until I complete a quest.

This likely wont affect me and my group, but it has the potential cause issues down the line. If someone leaves and we want to add a new player, that player now has a requirement to complete content whereas everyone else does not.

>If you decide to leave a group, you must pick one of two options. You can choose to:

>**Become a regular account**. You will lose GIM status and will also be removed from the GIM group and HiScores. You will also keep all levels, stats, quests, variables and untradeable items. You also get to keep your tradable items.

I guess I have questions on this wording then. What I read out of this is if you want to stay an Iron/Group Iron, you cannot keep tradables. However, if you choose to be a normal account (like a non-iron?) you may keep all your tradables.

I don't believe that the players playing IM now would do so if the game mode didn't exist since people are generally bad at self-regulating. But if playing GIM with your friends on your existing accounts is truly that important to you, then self-regulating is the way to go. Since if the helmet is the big deal, why would fresh GIM have to share this with ""cheating"" / ""skipping"" IM turned GIM?

2. Looking at the game modes we could view IM as mostly playing a Main but with filters applied, there are not many added features (mostly consists of blocked / removed features), GIM adds features that don't exist on Mains; shared vault, GIM ""Clans"". I doubt it's a tiny or simple change. If you truly are certain that a lot of people are willing to wait for this addition then gather up support and petition it during the weekly Q&As.

3. Obtaining a MA2 cape is probably easier as a group. This is why some HCIM pay people to guard them. Doing it as a HCIM you are risking your own HCIM status, doing it as a GHCIM you are risking the group's status. You would be affecting up to 4 other players. The risk of what you could lose is greater than a solo HCIM.",2021-09-01 13:55:10,1

WoW is an easy example. You grind mythic dungeons and raids for higher iLvl gear.. to keep doing those same things. Blizzard releases an expansion and gives you a new dungeon/raids to keep doing for new higher iLvl gear. But you need to level 5 or 10 levels first. And those levels immediately make your entire previous grind obselete, with better gear nearly instantly.

Imagine if your levels in Runescape were suddenly made obselete next month in an update and you had to do them again. That's what carrot on a stick design is.

The playerbase being half what it was during one of the biggest surges to the playerbase ever thanks to COVID, a popular League and mobile surge not too long before is fine. The playerbase is still up and up since the release of the game.

I know there ain't difference are we doing normal or group Ironman raiding! But the catch is I never reached that far in the game to do this, just like most other Ironmen who actually has a life what makes progressing solo-Ironman very slow compared to those who playes +8 hours a day. Even progressing non-Ironman mode is very slow despite free trade. Even boosting ain't possible to them because they don't have rich friends to help them out.

Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pfr3no/group_ironman_blog/,pfr3no,hb7012k,harrymuana,"1. A GIM helmet is in all regards less impressive than an IM helmet. At the start it may be special because the game mode is new, so maybe wait 6 months or so with making demotion available. But after that, GIM is basically easy mode of regular ironman, so if you demote yourself then you accept that your helmet will be of a lesser ""value"".
2. Main mode is unrestricted. GIM has added restrictions, e.g. trading is only allowed with your friends. Regular IM adds restrictions on top of that (no trading). Those restrictions are tested when you try the action (e.g. ironman still see the ""trade"" option with other players, they just get a message that it's unavailable when they try). Your status is just a variable that's bound to your account. Also asking it on a Q&A is literally what I'm doing so no idea why you have to bash so hard on this.
3. A GHCIM with 5 players has 5 lives. Again doing it 5 times solo is more impressive than once with a group of 5.

Group Ironman,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/pfr3no/group_ironman_blog/,pfr3no,hb74l0a,Deadly_Poison,"The ""value"" or ""impressiveness"" of the helmet is up to personal opinion. Personally, I would be more impressed by a GIM-helmet compared to an IM-helmet as the GIM would symbolize to me that they started fresh in late 2021 and hopefully played together as a team compared to having been able to start anytime since 2014. Therefore this point is kind of moot to even discuss. For some people it's very important, for some other it doesn't matter.

If you (and your friends) are willing to wait 6 months (or so), then do so. If they started playing irons this year (less than 9 months) they can take a 6-month break and come back in March and maybe the idea of starting fresh doesn't sound all too bad anymore. 

The point I tried to get across with the removed / blocked features is that GIM adds new features that aren't available to mains whilst regular IM doesn't offer anything that mains can't do. I'll try an analogy. If a main is a sandwich with everything on it, an IM is a sandwich with several ingredients removed (trading, GE, Aid, etc) and GIM is a sandwich with some ingredients removed (GE, trading outside of the group) but with a side dish not offered to the mains (shared vault, GIM clan window). It's fully possible that this fact doesn't make it harder to implement IM to GIM-switching, but it's also possible that it does make it harder and no longer a ""10-minute fix"". To jump back to the helmets, if it's important to you, make a Runelite-plugin and you'll get your GIM helmet. It's just a 10-minute fix, right? ;) If you care that other people outside your friend group don't see the helmets, I fail to see how hi-scores are of no importance to you but the helmet is, both are used to validate the player and the game mode.

The HCIM / GHCIM wasn't about how impressive it is to get the cape. You cannot avoid deaths 100% unless all you do is bankstand as a HCIM, so people that play regular HCIM could just recreate accounts over and over until all 5 of them have their ""dangerous items"" and then create a group, compared to the GHCIM-group that can't send one guy to recreate his character.",2021-09-01 15:27:36,1

The Kebos Lowlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/aei10v/the_kebos_lowlands/,aei10v,edtf0yy,Wontick,"I can tell you about boss Hydra. Range-only combat with a couple pray switches. Mechanics are re-used from other bosses, such as the Jad phase (Zulrah), poison spitting (Xarpus), and stun lightning (Great Olm). It is just an OK boss overall, which probably makes people with low standards very happy (but if you imply average is not good enough you might offend them).

Having to lure the boss Hydra onto the correct chemical spray is a pretty cool mechanic, along with the way the form changes every time the boss Hydra loses a head. Those two things build the boss's identity which makes it definitively different from other bosses, great design there. These two cool features almost make you forget that a bunch of the other mechanics are re-used when you fight it. By the way, there is nothing wrong with re-using mechanics if it's not done lazily.

Another cool idea from Kebos is the way the new Anima seeds and how they are introduced. They're untradeable and consumable, so the player must continually play the content (fight the Hespori). The effects they give impact all farming patches.

The graphics are great. But RS3 shows that great graphics are not good enough on their own. So hopefully we see more cool ideas that were in Kebos later, perhaps over time the OSRS team will have such great ideas they won't need to rely on Reddit.",2019-01-11 16:23:02,26

max efficiency would involve skipping pretty much everything besides barrage tasks, and a select few cannon tasks, while using slaughter for barrage and exped for cannon 

many people who don’t do max eff slayer will still cannon things like fire giants, while still not doing any barrage

new master makes it so you *have* to kill in certain areas, so she’ll take an inefficient bloodveld task that people still do/cannon and then force you to kill it in gwd where you not only can’t cannon, but there’s only like 2 spawns next to each other

How is this any better? All it does is save an inventory space, which isn't a major concern anywhere that you are using a bone crusher. 

> If this question passes, the Hydra tail will no longer be required to make a Bonecrusher necklace. Player who have already combined a Bonecrusher, Hydra tail and Dragonbone necklace to make the Bonecrusher necklace would be refunded one Hydra tail. 

So the Bonecrusher necklace will still be in game, but it requires no additional items other than a bonecrusher and dragonbone necklace to make?

And there would then be two possible equipable items that have the bone crusher effect, what is the point?

The respawn feature can already be done by exiting the room and re-entering, and having the feature force implemented for everyone could prevent fast runs where the Hydra spawns and drags onto the red vent immediately.

Noted bones are a huge buff to an already very profitable boss. We don't have this for Vorkath so why here? Especially problematic if the bones xp is increased.

The agility shortcut is exactly the opposite of the stated design intent of making the boss not accessible by a quick teleport. Keep it the way it is to encourage long trips.

The dragonbone necklace does not need any more buffs. Trading off passive prayer restoration versus offensive bonuses is balanced: free prayer restoration in the ammo slot is not.

Aerial fishing should not be instanced. Make the pools stay for 5-10 seconds regardless of catches done in them. Similarly to upper floor Motherlode Mine. Rebalance the rates around this if needed as you will possibly be able to catch multiple times from the same pool if it is close.

This would allow everyone to fish together, and be social in this mmorpg, instead of locking each other in our own instance to be efficient.

Alchemical hydras are still sitting at around 4-5m profit/hr, and hydra leather/claw will always be in demand because they're BiS.

After testing a couple hours, even on near-empty worlds, the xp rates don't seem to be as advertised. The biggest issue is when the fish spots spawn so far away from the island that it doubles or even triples the time it takes for the bird to fly to catch the fish.  
  
I think the max distance the pools spawn should be reduced by 2-3 squares, to allow for a more reliable xp rate, and the amount of pools that are up at a time should be increased.

All the aerial fishing changes I think are really good, except the increased rate of pearls. Just because there's more rewards doesn't mean they should be easier to get, plus if the Golden Tench trade in is added there's a good bonus to your pearls already. Angler Outfit from different content I think is a good idea, but it's definitely better experience than the Trawler, so the same rate of pearls should be fine.

With the addition on the outfit reward, aerial fishing will probably get more popular so the instanced area with all the additions seems good. Maybe add the ability to pre-pay though so you don't need to waste an inventory slot on coins.

&#x200B;

**Aerial Fishing:** I'm generally speaking not against instances and, though I have not thoroughly tested the Aerial Fishing myself I am fine with an instance being created. However, the social aspect is inherently lost, you can no longer meet new people if only those on your friend list can join. Furthermore, whilst I don't mind multiple ways of gathering an item I do fear for the Fishing Trawler mini game if Alry was to sell the outfit whilst you would gain half decent experience. The community talks a lot about reviving mini games, but thinking about changes as above might be a good start. Not saying it can't happen, just that it has potential downsides.

&#x200B;

**The Alchemical Hydra:** I love the uniques that were introduced to the game by means of the Alchemical Hydra the balance on them is just right and it is overall a terrific job. The mechanics of the boss are new and fun, and feel right for a slayer (Boss) monster. The ""side"" drops however... Whilst I understand drop tables are difficult. This monster's drops feel, even when taking into account that it can only be slain on task, overpowered. And I am genuinely concerned about inflation. I don't mind noted bones when the Elite Diary is required. The shortcut seems a bit of a nuisance, there is no real danger and even if there was one could prepare for that. I'm not a fan of changing the respawn, you can kill enough each hour as we speak and it limits further escalation of alchs entering the game. Secondly, for those new it adds a challenge as there is only so much time to clean up your inventory, one could consider the respawn timer a mechanic.

&#x200B;

**Wyrms, Drakes and regular Hydras:** I can't speak on this topic since I have not yet been able to try out the content.

&#x200B;

**Kourend Favour:** The fact that gaining favor for one party no longer decreases the favor one has at another party is rather nice, and I feel should have been implemented from the start. The 10k experience lamb... I mean, sure, why not. Though I don't see any reason whatsoever why you see any reason to make that change right now.

I know they wanted another money sink at 100k per death but for game integrity why not keep it the way it always has been in terms of slayer bosses. You would either fight for one of those three rooms, take the risk in the instance or do your task on the lower level versions of the boss.

You are talking about increasing the profitability of the ACH because of what? It is already BIS for money making because TWISTED BOW can literally skip whole phases of the boss. All your going to be doing is allowing people to complete more ACH per hour by the changes above and reducing the risk. Hydra Bones shouldn't be able to be noted. 

I have to ask if any of you guys actually play OSRS because the Kourend diary is a JOKE. The two tasks that are actually difficult in this new diary are the 77 RC and a raids completion. You already have a completely overpowered Elite Rewards by just completely making the new boots worthless if you have the diary done. Why do you do that? Why do I get an 8% chance of fish everywhere for the diary done when the FISHING CAPE does NOTHING. 

Why are you changing the price of function of the hydra tail? I don't understand moving the bonecrushee it to the ammo slot except completely changing the prayer bonus meta because the current BIS is +1 and it's hard to imagine anything that just buries bones doesn't have any type of prayer bonus. I can tell you for FACT that it will become more dead than it is if you make us choose between that and the blessing spot. 

Why does the cannon question have to be this difficult? Just don't allow cannons there? Why can I use a cannon but not walk with regular boots? Last time I checked STEEL is a great conductor of heat. 

I'm not sure who tested Aerial Fishing and said ""Yeah this is awesome and enjoyable"". While doing things because they are new is fun it gets really old to do content that provides less then 1/4 exp at my current level(82) when compared to LESS INTENSIVE 3 Tick fishing. Don't kid yourself, nobody is going to join private sessions to go aerial fishing except for bots unless you change the rewards. 

We have several tables full of WORTHLESS cosmetic items, why are we adding more? Come on, please make this content worth doing besides checking a box. Why don't you just fix the trawler? Why don't you add aerial fishing mechanics to a trawler so that we can get Manta Ray and Sea turtle besides a broken mini game and Zulrah. 

Regarding your proposed suggestions to the new creatures, I have a solution that would benefit everybody and the whole update. 

Introduce the Burn Mechanic and make it preventable by introducing a Anti-Burn Potion. You could add a new herb, herb seed and pick one of the WORTHLESS seconds that we have that will complete it. The new monsters will drop it and this even provides you an option to intro a shield in the future that prevents burn damage like DFS. 

Lastly, I want you guys to know that I am disappointed in the team. This release is GREAT and awesome but it feels like many of the smaller details were completely forgot about or rushed. How do you make multiple oversights that include a 2500 brew drop or a ring that stacks mage def reduces over and over? Instead of gathering proper data or information you make quick judgement based on posts on reddit without taking the time to see how many items are entering the game. I know that nothing is ever perfect but most people that play pay you guys good money to provide us awesome content that allows to escape the real world and enter the great world of Gielinor.

>Keep the special attack.


This is honestly fantastic. Yes it is tedious, but it brings me great joy to see people getting hit by these. Its a gatekeeper to prevent them from being botted and adds a small amount of skill and effort to grind them out. DO NOT REMOVE.

>Melee to melee, range to range.


If you melee, make it so they only use melee. If you range, make it only range. Why keep releasing content the favours range? Add more special attack stuff and make it challenging and fun to melee. Right now it's just dropping your cannon and protect range while you blowpipe them down because you take far too much damage if you melee.

>Adjust the drop table.


These things are literally ass shit garbage outside unique and their uniques aren't even that good. It's been a week and the uniques arent worth the grind. These are a step below Hydra but in terms of supply cost, its almost as costly but nowhere near as rewarding. Give some love for the mid game grind, end game already has ToB, raids 1, and now alchemical Hydra. You guys do realize it takes thousands of hours to get to that point right?

The current rate is about 10 pearls per hour, meaning you'd have to spend 40 hours of spam clicking and paying attention. 
Fishing trawler on the other hand is a 1/8 chance of an item. With games lasting around 10 minutes, let's say you do 8 games per 1.5 hours. This would mean you'd only have to afk the fishing trawler minigame for 6 hours. Even if you're super unlucky and it takes you 30 hours to get the full outfit it's still faster than aerial fishing.

If the rate goes from 1/100 to 1/85, that would mean you get close to 12 pearls per hour. if you divide 400 by 12, that's still over 33 hours. Aerial fishing is dead content as it is and won't become the new meta with the ideas jagex is currently proposing.",2019-01-18 20:52:05,1

You aren't sacrificing anything in order to get the outfit from aerial fishing.

When you go and get the lumberjack, farmer's, or current angler outfit you are dedicating time and effort to an activity that you wouldn't otherwise be doing, so it makes sense that you would be more rewarded by getting those outfits quickly. 

The opposite applies to this and also to Wintertodt. The pyromancer outfit pieces are 1/150, and you can get about 30 rolls per hour, so they are 5 hours each. But it's okay and no one is bothered by it because you are also getting good firemaking xp and some loot at the same time. ",2019-01-15 18:27:09,17

Any slayer boss (or boss in general) will be killed a lot on release until the hype dies down.  But Hydras can only be assigned by Konar who is inefficient to use in general which will impact the number of people using her unless they are skipping tasks.  This means the high tier items will become a lot more rare over time.

As for instances I dont see a problem with it for solo bosses as I just want to play the game instead of hopping 20 times.

One Tithe Farm reward I'd like to see come from the guild are Grape Seeds. The Vinery is dead content due to the lack of availability of the seeds. Nobody is gonna be spending their points on them. Having them come from Hespori and/or Contracts would make that piece of content actually do-able without costing an arm and a leg for little reward.

Bologa's Blessings are also an issue. So I'd say remove the dumb requirement to make them appear in the shop, and for you to get more of them per Tithe point.

Slightly unrelated but meh whatever: I'd like to see contract total rewards as well. At 1000 contracts give an ornament kit that can colour your secateurs golden like the Queen's Secateurs.

The problem with drake is that you lose money doing them and the task takes forever. I don't think buffing the drake bones will be a solution either as the main issue is how long it takes, banking the bones will only make this worse.

What drakes need is an actual incentive to kill them, their mechanics are fine. Maybe lower their hp a little to speed kills up and give their droptable another look, lowering their defense just makes blowpipe even better compared to other methods than it already is.

In the last thread I suggested adding volcanic ash to their table as a standard drop in a similar way to dragonhides, this is a stackable item that most people don't enjoy collecting, it fits their thematic and stacks which means it doesn't force more trips to the bank.

The thing with aerial fishing right now (from what I've heard and experienced), is that it's not worth doing at all, ESPECIALLY at lower levels. The people with high stats even complain that it's not worth training there, but for low/mid level players it's (sorry to say) complete trash.
I know it combines xp for 2 (3 if you count cutting the fish and getting cooking xp) skills, but for the high click intensity that it is, it's sure not rewarding. 

Talking to other people the rate of pearls seems to be somewhere between 7-11 pearls an hour, which means that the fish sack (which is just a cosmetic item from the info I could find (not sure if this is true?)) is, if taking 10 pearls average, a grind of non stop spam clicking for 100 hours! Some 99's don't even take that long to grind out. The aerial fishing needs a HUGE buff, and not in the form of an instanced area or adding rewards from an unpopular minigame to aerial fishing.

I'd suggest the following:

- **Slightly higher xp rates** (also for low levels). For the amount of clicking you have to do to maintain a consistent xp flow, you should be rewarded appropriately. Both hunter and fishing can be faster xp while you can afk them. (you'd think that click intensive things yield more xp, sadly that's not the case here)

- **Increasing the pearl rate**. Like I said earlier 100 hours of pure intense spam clicking (fighting other people ánd the time limit on the fish spawns, followed by spam dropping or cutting the fish takes a lot of effort) for a cosmetic reward is outrageous. Also I'd suggest that higher level fish have a slightly higher chance of receiving pearls, to make it more rewarding to actually train your skills.

- **Have more rewards in the shop** (not the fishing outfit). This could even be in the simplest form of buying raw fish in exchange for pearls, or access to a small island connected, where the fish spawns are a lot closer to shore in general (something like motherlode mine with the upstairs area).

- **Change the fish sack from just being cosmetic** (if this is the case) to be something like a coal bag and hold fish. (with above changes in mind I wouldn't even mind if the price of the fish sack then goes up to 1500 pearls).

It's okay to have content that's not as fast as other things, or a bit of a grind. However, I think aerial fishing is going to be dead content with it's current state, since it's **slow xp**, **high intensity clicking/paying attention**, AND **a huge and slow grind for any of the rewards**. Only the few die hard people will grind it out for the cosmetic rewards.",2019-01-17 05:09:40,1

Although I was in a 2k world in a less busy time, without a 2k world in a less busy time, the pkers would really cut into xp/h, not so much from killing you as you typically tank them in tank gear, but just from making you have to leave and bank constantly.

Taking it a bit further...maybe having the contracts work like the slayer system tasks. You are able to ""buy"" things with the points rewarded for doing certain contracts, if you downgrade you loose the streak.

Everyone with half a braincell on combat mechanics knows that speed is always ""OP"". That's why shortbows outclass longbows while using ammo several tiers weaker even.

Darts and knives were the pinnacle of speed, and then blowpipe came hadeadbutting the power levels. Most activities have blowpipe as BIS, if not it's still always viable alternative if ranged can be used at all.

I'd love to see a ""double-defense-scaling"" on it, making it significantly weaker in cases where the enemy is resistant to ranged attacks, making bows and crossbows more favourable, while still retaining its usefulness on **melting** lower-defense targets.

Similarly, ballistas could get a ""half-defense-scaling"", making them more accurate on high ranged def targets (relative to other ranged weapons). They could be the big ""tank buster"" items.",2019-01-16 08:34:07,23

Blowpipe vs. tbow doesn't affect your trip lengths. You're limited by 2 things: damage taken and prayer used. Damage taken is the exact same for both - you only take damage from the boss starting range, and tanking 1 lightning per kill if doing the lazy method.

That is balance is jagex fault for releasing another mage boss. It will be always blowpipe bis . A lot of people did not even want DHCB to work on hydra I thought it was wierd since I don’t think it’s Dragon Kin only in OSRS lore . 

You want to nerf blowpipe at hydra so dhcb is 2nd best in slot it’s a mage and that’s how TBow mechanics work . They nerfed it where it made no sense like Callisto and bandos . And a somewhat wierd nerf at zulrah but it makes sense at zulrah since you are only punished by using a 20k scroll not like vorkath or hydra where it’s 100k. 

When I started playing osrs like a bit less than 2 years ago I never ever wined about the TBow and I was poor as fuck but I set the goal of making money and getting my first boss pet at zulrah in that time it was nerfed where it was unbalanced like bandos and Callisto because they are warriors . Now people just asking for nerfs where it makes sense it should work how it should.

TLDR it’s a mage boss not a warrior or ranger. 
Blame Jagex for another mage boss . Don’t ask to nerf a weapon that is unabtainable by 99% of the player base . They misled the player base by making us think it would be killed with melee it’s an enjoyable boss nothing needs to change.",2019-01-16 04:03:40,1

The only counter argument I can think of is that during each kill ruby bolts can deal \~30-40 damage to you with decent procs so do take more damage than using a bp and effectively get less kills per hour.

Overall, without uniques, they are about 500k-600k gp/h. On task, I was killing anywhere between 60-70 of them per hour using either a Blowpipe or using Magic (Tome of Fire/SoTD Fire Surge). 

The real issue isn't that they are a lot of effort to kill...they are extremely low effort if using Range or Mage and using Protect from Range. Having to move 1 tile every 10-20 seconds does not make it high effort. The actual issue is their massive health pool. They take a very long amount of time to kill, meaning that each task of them is something like 1^1/2 - 2 hours long. The most similar gp/h task would probably be Gargoyles, however, due to Drake's massive defenses, they are roughly equal gp/h to gargoyles, but much less xp/h.


To remedy this, lowering their total health pool, or lowering their defenses to make Magic more useful than it currently is, would allow them to be equal xp/h to gargoyles, while also being more gp/h due to access to Konar's drop table and their own unique table (Claw/Tooth).",2019-01-15 21:57:36,1

Also your team could put down flares which made your catapult map square light up so you knew where to shoot.

Not only did this update free the helm slot, it redesigned the arena like pre-eoc with only 1 tile accessible to the ladders.

Now it's even worse with max sets and a pre-eoc style arena where scorers have more limited options around the floors. Scorers have the burden of effort.   
  
There's little incentive to learn castle wars mechanics with barricades and burning and pathing in the theme world. It just looks like PKing in a castle wars arena like most players have treated it for decades. But you cannot utilize the unique castle wars supplies if you have a dozen maxers speccing you at the same time. 

I suggest nerfing the castle wars brace's damage boost against the flag holder. Completely out of date anyway most pvp-minded players are decently good at focusing a target today. Also nerf the rewards for 0-0 games. Make it a big jump from scoreless ties to scoring games.

A lot of people perceived ancients as OP, when really, all they needed to do was maybe equip some D-hide or take off their full rune.

I've spent the majority of my playtime the last few weeks in the wilderness and it is *so easy* to either escape or lose very little with even a tiny amount of planning.

Anywhere you're not in combat: player alarm -> hotkey hop worlds

Anywhere you're in sub-30 wild: player alarm -> one-click tele (which have gotten expanded thanks to menu entry swapper.  secret pker nerf???)

Where those aren't an option, PVM suicide is a *massive* advantage for non-pkers thanks to gravestone mechanics.  Broken and very difficult to counterplay.

I've lost *maybe* 4m in pvp deaths, meanwhile I've made 150m and a nice chunk of exp.  Half those losses were because I wasn't paying attention (avoidable even with my limited skillset) and the other half could have been avoided or minimized if I knew how to freeze/stepunder or bolt rag.

And the great thing is, when I don't feel like the risk, *I can just go do other content*.  98% of the game is outside of the wild.  There's nothing forcing me to go there, and even if I do there's nothing forcing me to take significant risk.

Aggressive doesn't mean they attack players outside their current target in single-way combat? Honestly, I'm trying to think of another boss that does something like this and I can't think of one.. but if I did, I'd say that should be fixed too.

Tbf, why would someone report this? It helps them. A dev isn't looking at this like ""wow I gotta help that PKer!"".. They're looking at it like ""huh, this is single-way combat. That shouldn't be targeting other players"".

I think TOA's scaling is a problem, but i dont think the solution is ""make the scaling less worthwhile"".

The issue with scaling is its uninteresting. Fights are longer, defence is higher, damage / mistakes are more punishing.

Thats not that interesting, and i agree. Its why **i dont do it**. I'm not too fussed if i can create a more enjoyable raid if it means i raid more hours in total for my Shadow drop or whatever. 

I'm always involved in conversations discussing what is wrong / not great feeling about TOA. I agree invocation / raid level and scaling doesn't feel good.

Let’s compare competitive castle wars with CSGO, amongst the largest esports in the game.

1.	5 man teams, almost entirely skill related, people have defined roles and strategies to play the map.
2.	Defined goals, defuse the bomb and plant the bomb, castle wars goal, capture the flag and defend the flag. You strategize your composition and game play based on your goals.
3.	Almost entirely skill, all games have RNG aspects to them and you’re an idiot of you say otherwise. Most people saying it’s unplayable because of RNG have never pk’ed in their lives, a good pker vs a shit pker has obvious differences. Sure someone can get lucky, in CSGO you can have a noob get a lucky AWP shot. However the game is one by individual skill and team play.
4.	Game outcome is decided entirely on individual skill and team skill.
5.	CSGO starts at nothing but builds based of the winning team having more money to spend on better gear and weapons. You can make it so every round teams have 60 seconds to change their load out, all players have the same stats.
6.	it’d be 100% more enjoyable and competitive than DMM fuck fest where the solo rounds are almost entirely based off RNG than skill. You could be the best pker in the world and not make it to solos because there’s 1,000 players barraging everything in sight. Individual skill is not rewarded, whoever has the bigger clan is. A solo pker can almost never get into 1v1’s.

I'm thinking something like each team gets a basic portal system of some kind, but it can be disabled by the enemy team in some way.

DMM works because PVP (in the traditional single/multi pking sense) is popular among a large portion of players, is popular among CONTENT CREATORS who people WANT TO WATCH, and because it provides content for those who arent interested in PVP (the skiling/grinding).

I know because I've tried getting my friends I play other games with into osrs...

**CSGO**, install the game, hit level 2 and queue for competitive.

**LoL**, install the game do the 10 minute tutorial, queue for normal 5's.

**WoW**, buy the game and recieve a level 110 boost then it's just 10 levels to unlock all the content you watched on streams even if it's LFR and not HC or queue for arena.

Ok so let's start with getting 94 magic, buy 220,000 nature runes and manually click the exact same spot on your screen for 440,000 clicks...

That being said, osrs still has no esports potential because, to be perfectly honest, it's insanely boring to watch. The entire game is built on an old, clunky tick based system. Furthermore, most of the skill involved in pking isn't really visible from a 3rd person perspective (which is why people think there isn't any skill required).

Compare this to games like league, cs, melee, etc. and you'll see how much worse osrs is. Complete freedom of movement vs. distinct squares on the ground. Extremely fast and responsive controls vs. a .6 second tick system that essentially gives you massive input delay. Extremely fast paced games vs. a game where you have 20 second freezes and 2.4-3.6 seconds between most attacks. In any of the other 3 games, 2.4-3.6 seconds can easily decide the fate of an entire game, and in a top level tribrid fight in osrs they will regularly spend that much time just waiting for the next attack without doing anything.",2019-05-13 23:19:27,0

Excluding OSRS for that reason is silly. Do I think it can compete with big name E-sports? Hell no. I still think it's smart what Jagex is trying to do in pushing OSRS in the E-sports direction because it's putting the Old School name out there, revitalizing interest for many. 

Jagex has already hosted many events in the past that would put OSRS in E-sports territory as is. I know OSRS isn't what you would traditionally think of as an E-sport compared to the more popular ones, nor do I know what even officially classifies a game as an E-sport - but honestly Jagex has done a great job keeping such an old game fresh in people's minds through competitive tournaments.

All they need to do is put a fighter torso equivalent item and you will see people more involved in it. Also the mechanics and gameplay of CW could use an update. I love CW and would gladly play more of it if it had purpose. When I was younger and played in 07 castle wars was what motivated me to train CB so I could actually feel relevant in the minigame. Flash forward to now and I'm sitting at 85-90s with only pvm to do. CW has a lot of potential and all of your points can be addressed with just a good update to gameplay and rewards. Personally speaking I dont watch any of the OSRS ""esports"" content because clanmanmode is a joke and not something that's available to the ordinary player and the 1v1 tournaments are cool to watch the switches but very straight forward in what's going to happen. Someone will die and they move on to the next round.

There are certain components that make a mode competitive. It may not be fun for everybody, but out of all the modes in the game that exists to me it seems the most sound of them all. There's a clear objective that's as old as time - capture the enemy flag and bring it back to your own base. Very easy for outsiders to understand how the game works without even playing and by watching they can learn about all of the side objectives to complete to allow for primary objective completion - killing off competition or simply putting as many obstacles in their way as possible through PvP interaction or by the items supplied inside the mode. There's also a stealth aspect to it where you don't even have to engage and you could quietly score without anyone noticing. It works better than clan wars in my opinion because clan wars ultimately comes down to a pure PvP standpoint, which can get very stale quickly. Don't get me wrong, clan wars are exciting, but when it comes down to the bread and butter it's basically a team deathmatch.
