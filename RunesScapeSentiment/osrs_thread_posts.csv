F2P Castle Wars,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/bo80mk/jagex_mentioned_they_are_looking_for_more/,bo80mk,Jagex mentioned they are looking for more competitive game mode ideas - A reminder that competitive Castle Wars has insane esport potential.,"**NOTE:** This discussion is about a **5v5** or a **6v6** competitive game mode. Casual players can still go play the existing game mode, and DMM can still exist.

I don't really have the time to sit here for hours and make a list of suggestions or theorycraft a better solution for a competitive CW game mode, but I seriously don't understand why this hasn't attracted more attention. It's quite possibly one of the best and most objective-based game modes. Plenty of teamwork, insane mechanics and strategy with explosives/barricades and flag juggling. The game could be easily balanced and diversified if there was even a hint of effort applied to this idea. I mean hell, why not host a competition to design more competitive maps so the game stays fresh? Four or five strategic maps, 5v5/6v6, balance/change certain items/weapons/armor if needed and watch teams form and take this shit seriously. It honestly blows my mind that this isn't the top suggestion over the DMM grindfest, mass unorganized PvP into the massacre at the end of every season. There's very little guarantee or any skill-based interaction going on until the 1v1s after the death fog kills everyone off. There needs to be some structure for a mode so people can theorycraft, strategize and learn/abuse mechanics within reason - THAT'S what makes a game fun. I might get some hate for sharing my opinion, but that's just how I feel - I'm not trying to claim my opinion on DMM is more important than anybody else's.

If anybody hasn't already seen what competitive castle wars could be, take some time to watch some [**top plays**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwnjnmeCpWU) from April. The commentator does a great job explaining what is happening.

**EDIT** : Lots of ideas and discussion in the comments, such as:
- providing the stats and gear inside the minigame to avoid grinding as a requirement to even compete, like how a tournament world works
- defined roles
- adding an ELO system
- expanding the rewards table, maybe through a community competition to incentivize new or returning players to give the game mode another shot
- more discussion in the comments discussing the viability with an ""RNG-based"" combat system - VERY debatable considering how many other factors play into the PvP system
- why I chose Castle Wars over other ideas:
>There are certain components that make a mode competitive. There's a clear objective - capture the enemy flag and bring it back to your own base. Very easy for outsiders to understand how the game works without even playing and by watching they can learn about all of the side objectives to complete to allow for primary objective completion - killing off competition or simply putting as many obstacles in their way as possible through PvP interaction or by the items supplied inside the mode. There's also a stealth aspect, where you don't even have to engage and quietly score without anyone noticing. It works better than clan wars in my opinion because clan wars ultimately comes down to a pure PvP standpoint, which can get stale. When it comes down to the bread and butter clan wars basically a team deathmatch. Any successful competitive game out there has an objective-based game mode.

**TL;DR - Jagex insisting on competitive suggestions in their latest blog post. DMM is extremely flawed. Lots of grinding, shit show and luck-based until 1v1s, no objective except for don't die. Castle Wars is objective-based, has many mechanics that emphasize skill-based interaction far beyond PvP interactions. These types of game modes are what make games competitive.
