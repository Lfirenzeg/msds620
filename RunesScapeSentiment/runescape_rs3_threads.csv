MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1lk7xo0/the_future_of_mtx_our_approach_your_involvement/,1lk7xo0,The Future of MTX - Our Approach & Your Involvement,"Our approach to MTX is harming RuneScape. The process of change starts now.

Experiments like Disabling Treasure Hunter, preventing use of some MTX-based skilling items in our Autumn DXP & more await in the next three months. Together, we’ll learn what we need to make some big changes.

Watch the video for an overview, or hit the blog for a more detailed rundown of our plans and commitments: [https://rs.game/FutureOfMTX](https://rs.game/FutureOfMTX)

*---*  
*Little extra on this too:*

*I’m sure you will have a ton of questions on the Experiments and what might happen to X or Y while they run. I will do my best to answer those questions (and more beyond) in this thread.*

*For those we don’t have definitive answers on, don't worry - we will be providing a more detailed look at each experiment \~2 weeks before they go live. This will give us time to answer those questions and get a read on any early concerns with what we're testing.*",JagexHooli,2025-06-25 14:58:27,2179,0.91
MTX pause,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1loxe8u/mtx_experiment_1_disabling_th_july_22_28/,1loxe8u,MTX Experiment 1: Disabling TH (July 22 - 28),"Hey everyone. We've seen a few folks confused on when you can expect our first Experiment to take place. 

We committed to communicating early and often, so we've fast-tracked the release of our first Experiment blog to make sure everything is super clear! Find it here: [https://rs.game/MTXExperiment1](https://rs.game/MTXExperiment1)

As a reminder, our core three Experiments - 'Disabling Treasure Hunter', 'DXP With Only Bonus XP Available', and the 'Cosmetic Mega Drop' - all last no more than two weeks, with one arriving each month. 

We'll also have a longer running bonus Experiment with Cosmetic-Free Worlds, which will run for at least four weeks beginning in August.

To help further, I'm working with the team to get final timelines we can communicate for the other Experiments. We'll update the original blog as soon as we have these locked and let you know.

*Final bit from me: Please remember Experiments are built to teach us what we need to know. Everything you see is about learning and not necessarily representative of our final approach.*    
  
*We want to hear your perspectives on anything and everything about them. All we ask is for feedback to be presented constructively so we can listen, learn and identify what needs to be part of our final proposed approach.*",JagexHooli,2025-07-01 09:40:08,397,0.95

Necromancy,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/163pxlr/unpopular_opinion_necromancy_isnt_that/,163pxlr,"Unpopular Opinion - Necromancy isn’t that overpowered, you just like being gatekeepers to bossing and drops.","I keep seeing posts about how necromancy is overpowered and needs a ton of nerfs. I also see comments under posts from players that just got their first Telos/Nex/Ambassador kill with Necro that they need to “Git Gud” at bosses with “proper” styles like magic and range. 

I hate to break this to you all but I’m not sorry that necromancy was made for players to get into PVM outside of the existing combat skills.  Im not sorry your 10 billion+ gear isn’t the only Meta in town. I’m not sorry 4 ticking isn’t the only way players can get better kill times, and I’m also not sorry that your overinflated boss drops are falling to prices people can afford.

However, I am sorry that you need to berate players getting into PVM and are excited to play new content.

We have been asking Jagex non stop about bringing the game up to speed to attract new players. They create a radically new combat style for a game that is most combat focused on the endgame, and the “elite” PVM gamers in this community start bitching that their precious FSOA isn’t the only way to be good at the game. 

These players need to get over yourself. This is a 120 combat skill, it’s GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN A 99 SKILL. 

On top of that, new players don’t want to learn 5 switches, 10 boss mechanics, do 84 quests, level 16 skills to 120, get 9 mid level boss drops, and setup 64 key binds just to get into high tier PVM. New players want to learn a simple rotation, get into a fight, learn a few mechanics and survive/win. They don’t care about kill times at first, they just don’t want to get into a fight and always die. Necromancy is a crutch skill for bosses in this way, and that’s ok and we should celebrate players who are learning PVM with Necromancy.

I also I nderstand that good players are using Necro and getting record setting kill times. You know what? THATS OK TOO! Top tier PVMers SHOULD GET THE BEST TIMES with a powerful new style. Just because it’s not with an FSOA or a BoTLG and it’s with gear that’s accessible to all players doesn’t make your achievements any less important. There will be more bosses and gear and levels to come that will raise the bar  for those styles again. Necro just gives the game accessibility to a larger player base that we sorely need so the game continues to stay alive.",ResponsibleSpeaker28,2023-08-28 15:59:06,1127,0.8
New Foundations & DXP,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1jdkjny/jagex_accidentally_created_a_whole_new_game_genre/,1jdkjny,"Jagex ""accidentally"" created a whole new game genre.","A lot of Runescape players love to hate on the 0.6s tick rate, but the truth is: it forced Jagex to come up with a combat style that’s actually fun, challenging and super skill-expressive. It’s not just button mashing, and it’s not some boring turn-based thing either. There’s real depth to it.

You can really see this when you look at the skill gap between different players. Some people struggle with basic PvM, while others are out here breaking records with insane strategies. The fact that there are so many ways to optimize kills and set records just shows how much depth the system has.

RuneScape’s combat is kind of in this weird middle ground between a rhythm game and an action RPG. It’s got the structured timing of a turn-based RPG mixed with the core mechanics of a rhythm game, but it's also got the reaction-based decision-making of an action game. Yeah, there are known optimal rotations for bosses, but actually pulling them off? That’s a whole different story. Also, it’s not just about pressing the same buttons in the same order every time, many things can go wrong, and when they do, you have to improvise on the fly.

A lot of people say they can’t get into PvM because the game feels clunky or laggy due to the way the current tick system works. They blame the 0.6s intervals for making combat feel unresponsive, but I'm pretty sure that if the game had ticks of 20ms they’d still struggle just as much. The issue isn’t the tick rate itself, it’s the skill expression and decision-making required to play at a high level.

Jagex might not have meant to, but they created something completely unique. The 0.6s rate does not ruin combat, it laid the foundation for an entirely new genre of video games.",Jaccoud,2025-03-17 18:54:50,441,0.82

Since Archaeology's release on the 30th of March various changes (as result of your feedback) have already been made. Here is an overview of them!

**Overview of the Changes made since Archaeology's release:**

* Inspecting a damaged or restored artefact and filling or inspecting a soil box will no longer interrupt your current action, allowing you to continue excavating uninterrupted.
* Players may now use either a Harlequin cow, or one each of a Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate cow during the relevant Archaeology mystery.
* A tick has been added to Artefact information to show if you have previously completed any associated collections.
* The chance of receiving an artefact from research has been increased.
* Dr Nabanik's 'Third-age Expert' researcher perk has been modified to guarantee an artefact after researching 2 hours or more, down from 8 hours or more.
* We have adjusted the text associated with the consumable items found in the Archaeology Guild shop so that both their Item and Buff Bar descriptions are consistent.
* The Dwarven Instinct aura will now spawn magical chests after you've earned XP in Archaeology.
* An Armadylean yellow material cache at Stormguard Citadel has been moved slightly to make it more accessible.
* Corrected a typo where the collector Isaura was mispronouncing her own name. We've all been there, Isaura.
* A vanilla, Chocolate & strawberry cow can now be used for the Capricorn portion of the Contract Claws mystery.
* The Slayer and Boss Collection logs will now open correctly when accessed via the Slayer counter.
* Fixed a texture Z-fighting issue on Stormguard Citadel.
* Fixed an issue with some missing geometry in Stormguard Citadel.
* Fixed an issue where some research was not being unlocked.
* Fixed an issue where Player Owned Ports voyages were being set to a negative duration while claiming research rewards.
* Fixed an issue where the Player Owned Farm trapper farmhand was not returning.
* Fixed an issue that allowed players to gain a pulse core level boost in Archaeology from the Desert Pantheon aura. This has now been locked behind the skill amnesty period.
* Fixed an issue that allowed the waterfiend familiar to be summoned for a longer duration than intended.
* Summoning pets will no longer run away if they are following you when you log out.
* Fixed an issue that prevented some players from completing the Contact Claws mystery if they had already completed the Dagon Bye mystery. Players will now be better informed about their Contract Claws mystery progress when speaking to Movario.
* Complete tomes can no longer be stored in the Bank.
* Running out of skillchompas as you reach max focus when excavating will no longer crash the player.
* Fixed an issue where additional Twitch loot crates were unintentionally awarded.
* It is once again possible to obtain the Booboo doll needed to complete The Lost Toys miniquest.
* A bookshelf on the Archaeology Guild Campus that was used to start the Elemental Workshop II quest had been lost during renovations. This has been replaced, so it is now possible to start the quest.
* Chests in the Infernal Source cellar can no longer be looted with a full inventory.
* Fixed an issue where players couldn't fletch Bakriminal bolts if they already had some in their inventory.
* Using the Font of Life from your inventory will now correctly progress the Archaeology tutorial.

**Hotfixes since Monday's game-update:**
* Adjusted the drop rate of Imcando mattock pieces, making it increasingly more common with a higher Archaeology level.
* Guildmaster Tony's mattock has been adjusted to a precision value of 85 (down from 90).The tool tip interface will continue to state 90 until the next game update.
